 indices represented in a piecewise linear    manner. An automated
 segmentation algorithm    converges to an optimum segmented time
 series    representation, which achieves considerable data   
 compression and allows variable sampling rate of    the time
 series depending on different segments    having different length.
 Then, we propose a    practical method to determine the minimum
 embedding    dimension from the segmented time series. The   
 novelty of this approach is that it is applied on    segmented
 representations and that it returns the    minimum embedding
 dimension measured in number of    segments. It also has the
 following advantages: (1)    does not contain subjective
 parameters; (2) works	  with any number of segments; (3) can
 detect    deterministic time series; (4) is computationally   
 efficient. We use the minimum embedding dimension    as an
 indicator of the length of patterns that can	 be retrieved from
 the time series own past using    our pattern matching technique.
 This technique    enables the matching of historical patterns of  
  similar shape which occur in different time scales.	 To define
 an appropriate similarity measure, we	  introduce the notation of
 Multiple Feature Sets	  (MFS) which employ Dynamic Time Warping
 (DTW) and    first derivative and temporal features. An   
 additional advantage of the system we propose is    that the
 segmented representation scheme and the    prediction model are
 both data driven and that the	  predictions are made using
 information only from	  the time-series own past without any a
 priori    knowledge being injected into the model. We	 
 demonstrate that this approach may offer a useful    decision
 support tool for stock market trading.",,"University of Plymouth -Centre for Neural & Adaptive Systems, University of Plymouth",,,,"Banavas GN, Denham S, Denham MJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Computing in Economics and Finance 2000,,,FAST NONLINEAR DETERMINISTIC FORECASTING OF SEGMENTED STOCK INDICES USING PATTERN MATCHING AND EMBEDDING TECHNIQUES.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,RePEc:sce:scecf0:64,RePEc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,No

One reason for placing criminals behind bars--aside from punishment and protecting the public--is to prevent them from engaging in further risky criminal activities. Limited attention has been paid to whether being inside or outside prison affects offenders' risk-taking behaviors and attitudes. We compared risk-taking behaviors and attitudes in five risk domains (ethical, financial, health/safety, recreational, social) among 75 incarcerated offenders (i.e., offenders who are currently in prison) and 45 ex-offenders (i.e., offenders who have just been released from prison). Ex-offenders reported higher likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, driven largely by a willingness to take more risks in the recreational and ethical domains.

One reason for placing criminals behind bars--aside from punishment and protecting the public--is to prevent them from engaging in further risky criminal activities. Limited attention has been paid to whether being inside or outside prison affects offenders' risk-taking behaviors and attitudes. We compared risk-taking behaviors and attitudes in five risk domains (ethical, financial, health/safety, recreational, social) among 75 incarcerated offenders (i.e., offenders who are currently in prison) and 45 ex-offenders (i.e., offenders who have just been released from prison). Ex-offenders reported higher likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, driven largely by a willingness to take more risks in the recreational and ethical domains.

An electrophysiological component, feedback related negativity, has been claimed to encode an RPE but its relative sensitivity to the utility of positive and negative RPEs remains unclear. This study explored the question by varying the utility of positive and negative RPEs in a design that controlled for other closely related properties of feedback and could distinguish utility from salience. It revealed a mediofrontal sensitivity to utility, for positive RPEs at 275-310ms and for negative RPEs at 310-390ms.

The findings indicated some positive changes in the young people's attachment security over time, for example, a reduction in extreme reactions and a trust that adults could understand their feelings (PAE - parental accurate empathy). However, despite this PAE, the young people did not expect adults to enact this by offering them support, and this lack of expectation persisted over the 1-year period. Specific differences in relation to placement success were suggested in that young people for whom their placements broke down indicated more initial fearful and aggressive representations of adults.

In observational training, a category label is presented, followed by an example of that category and the participant's response.  In feedback training, the stimulus is presented, the participant assigns it to a category and then receives feedback about the accuracy of that decision.  Ashby, Maddox, and Bohil (2002) reported that feedback training was superior to observational training when learning information-integration category structures, but that training type had little effect on the acquisition of rule-based category structures.  These results were argued to support the COVIS dual-process account of category learning.  However, a number of non-essential differences between their rule-based and information-integration conditions complicate interpretation of these findings.  Experiment 1 controlled, between category structures, for participant error rates, category separation, and the number of stimulus dimensions relevant to the categorization.  Under these more controlled conditions, rule-based and information-integration category structures both benefitted from feedback training to a similar degree.  Experiment 2 maintained this difference in training type when learning a rule-based category that had otherwise been matched, in terms of category overlap and overall performance, with the rule-based categories used in Ashby et al.  These results indicate that differences in dimensionality between the category structures in Ashby et al. is a more likely explanation for the interaction between training type and category structure than the dual-system explanation they offered.",2014-07-05,,,,,"Edmunds CER, Milton F, Wills AJ",http://www.willslab.co.uk/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,1203,1222,,,,,,,2015-01-09,Published,,,,,2014-08-12,,,,,,,Feedback can be superior to observational training for both rule-based and information-integration category structures,Article,,68,,,9,9,7,9,1.709266,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology (1747-0218),A,,,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology (1747-0218),0.961,No,,green,10/03/2018 08:00:48,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/3064,Yes,Live,Unknown,8DC7D73C-A596-47DB-A183-5B6FB8C31429,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Research has, however, reported wide differences in individuals' desires to be involved in the decision-making process, and these differences in preferences are likely to be the result of a number of factors including age, education and numeracy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients at genetic risk for cancer had preferences for shared decision making that differed depending on medical domain (general health vs. cancer) and whether decision preferences are linked to numeracy abilities. METHODS: Four hundred and seventy-six women who consented to participate in response to an email sent by a local branch of the U.S.-based Cancer Genetics Network (CGN) to its members. Participants completed the Control Preference Scale, as well as an objective and subjective numeracy scales. RESULTS: Decision domain (cancer vs. general health) was not associated with women's preferences for involvement in decision making. Objective and subjective numeracy predicted a preference for decision involvement in general, and only objective numeracy was predictive with regard to cancer. CONCLUSION: Participants were equally likely to state they wanted to play an active, collaborative or passive role in both medical domains (general and cancer). High-numeracy participants were more likely to express a desire for an active role in general and in case they were diagnosed with cancer.

We introduced a novel procedure that controls for response bias. In Experiments 1 and 2, the task required judging which of two simultaneously presented syllogisms was valid. Surprisingly, there was no evidence for belief bias with this forced choice procedure. In Experiment 3, the procedure was modified so that only one set of premises was viewable at a time. An effect of beliefs emerged: unbelievable conclusions were judged more accurately, supporting the claim that beliefs affect the quality of reasoning. Experiments 4 and 5 replicated and extended this finding, showing that the effect was mediated by individual differences in cognitive ability and analytic cognitive style. Although the positive findings of Experiments 3-5 are most relevant to the debate about the mechanisms underlying belief bias, the null findings of Experiments 1 and 2 offer insight into how the presentation of an argument influences the manner in which people reason.

OCS impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) have not been quantified. Asthma HRQoL scales are valid as outcome measures for patients requiring OCS only if they assess the deficits imposed by OCS. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the burden of disease and treatment in patients with severe asthma with items in eight asthma-specific HRQoL scales. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with severe asthma recruited from a severe asthma clinic were interviewed about the impact of their respiratory symptoms and the burden of their treatment. The domains from a thematic analysis of these interviews were compared with the items of eight asthma-specific HRQoL scales. RESULTS: In addition to the burden caused by symptoms, ten domains of OCS impact on HRQoL were identified: depression, irritability, sleep, hunger, weight, skin, gastric, pain, disease anxiety, and medication anxiety. Some patients experienced substantial HRQoL deficits attributed to OCS. Although all HRQoL scales include some OCS-relevant items, all eight scales fail to adequately assess the several types of burden experienced by some patients while on OCS. CONCLUSION: The burden of OCS in severe asthma is neglected in policy and practice because it is not assessed in outcome studies. Existing asthma HRQoL scales provide an overly positive estimation of HRQoL in patients with frequent exposure to OCS and underestimate the benefit of interventions that reduce OCS exposure.

Incidences were estimated using reports of accidental awareness as the numerator, and a parallel national anaesthetic activity survey to provide denominator data. The incidence of certain/probable and possible accidental awareness cases was ~1:19,600 anaesthetics (95% confidence interval 1:16,700-23,450). However, there was considerable variation across subtypes of techniques or subspecialities. The incidence with neuromuscular block (NMB) was ~1:8200 (1:7030-9700), and without, it was ~1:135,900 (1:78,600-299,000). The cases of AAGA reported to NAP5 were overwhelmingly cases of unintended awareness during NMB. The incidence of accidental awareness during Caesarean section was ~1:670 (1:380-1300). Two-thirds (82, 66%) of cases of accidental awareness experiences arose in the dynamic phases of anaesthesia, namely induction of and emergence from anaesthesia. During induction of anaesthesia, contributory factors included: use of thiopental, rapid sequence induction, obesity, difficult airway management, NMB, and interruptions of anaesthetic delivery during movement from anaesthetic room to theatre. During emergence from anaesthesia, residual paralysis was perceived by patients as accidental awareness, and commonly related to a failure to ensure full return of motor capacity. One-third (43, 33%) of accidental awareness events arose during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia, mostly due to problems at induction or towards the end of anaesthesia. Factors increasing the risk of accidental awareness included: female sex, age (younger adults, but not children), obesity, anaesthetist seniority (junior trainees), previous awareness, out-of-hours operating, emergencies, type of surgery (obstetric, cardiac, thoracic), and use of NMB. The following factors were not risk factors for accidental awareness: ASA physical status, race, and use or omission of nitrous oxide.

A striking finding was that 75% of experiences were for <5 min, yet 51% of patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 43-60%] experienced distress and 41% (95% CI 33-50%) suffered longer term adverse effect. Distress and longer term harm occurred across the full range of experiences but were particularly likely when the patient experienced paralysis (with or without pain). The patient's interpretation of what is happening at the time of the awareness seemed central to later impact; explanation and reassurance during suspected AAGA or at the time of report seemed beneficial. Quality of care before the event was judged good in 26%, poor in 39%, and mixed in 31%. Three-quarters of cases of AAGA (75%) were judged preventable. In 12%, AAGA care was judged good and the episode not preventable. The contributory and human factors in the genesis of the majority of cases of AAGA included medication, patient, and education/training. The findings have implications for national guidance, institutional organization, and individual practice. The incidence of 'accidental awareness' during sedation (~1:15,000) was similar to that during general anaesthesia (~1:19,000). The project raises significant issues about information giving and consent for both sedation and anaesthesia. We propose a novel approach to describing sedation from the patient's perspective which could be used in communication and consent. Eight (6%) of the patients had resorted to legal action (12, 11%, to formal complaint) at the time of reporting.

The 5th National Audit Project (NAP5) was designed to investigate the reported incidence, predisposing factors, causality, and impact of accidental awareness. METHODS: A nationwide network of local co-ordinators across all the UK and Irish public hospitals reported all new patient reports of accidental awareness to a central database, using a system of monthly anonymized reporting over a calendar year. The database collected the details of the reported event, anaesthetic and surgical technique, and any sequelae. These reports were categorized into main types by a multidisciplinary panel, using a formalized process of analysis. RESULTS: The main categories of accidental awareness were: certain or probable; possible; during sedation; on or from the intensive care unit; could not be determined; unlikely; drug errors; and statement only. The degree of evidence to support the categorization was also defined for each report. Patient experience and sequelae were categorized using current tools or modifications of such. CONCLUSIONS: The NAP5 methodology may be used to assess new reports of AAGA in a standardized manner, especially for the development of an ongoing database of case reporting.

OCS impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) have not been quantified. Asthma HRQoL scales are valid as outcome measures for patients requiring OCS only if they assess the deficits imposed by OCS. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the burden of disease and treatment in patients with severe asthma with items in eight asthma-specific HRQoL scales. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with severe asthma recruited from a severe asthma clinic were interviewed about the impact of their respiratory symptoms and the burden of their treatment. The domains from a thematic analysis of these interviews were compared with the items of eight asthma-specific HRQoL scales. RESULTS: In addition to the burden caused by symptoms, ten domains of OCS impact on HRQoL were identified: depression, irritability, sleep, hunger, weight, skin, gastric, pain, disease anxiety, and medication anxiety. Some patients experienced substantial HRQoL deficits attributed to OCS. Although all HRQoL scales include some OCS-relevant items, all eight scales fail to adequately assess the several types of burden experienced by some patients while on OCS. CONCLUSION: The burden of OCS in severe asthma is neglected in policy and practice because it is not assessed in outcome studies. Existing asthma HRQoL scales provide an overly positive estimation of HRQoL in patients with frequent exposure to OCS and underestimate the benefit of interventions that reduce OCS exposure.

How can we ensure good decisions? We present research on heuristics-simple rules of thumb-and discuss how medical decision-making can benefit from these tools. We challenge the common view that heuristics are only second-best solutions by showing that they can be more accurate, faster, and easier to apply in comparison to more complex strategies. Using the example of fast-and-frugal decision trees, we illustrate how heuristics can be studied and implemented in the medical context. Finally, we suggest how a heuristic-friendly culture supports the study and application of heuristics as complementary strategies to existing decision rules.",2014-10-11,,,,,"Bodemer N, Hanoch Y, Katsikopoulos KV",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25348561,,,,,10.1007/s11739-014-1143-y,,,1970-9366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Intern Emerg Med,"Clinical Decision-Making, Decision Support Techniques, Heuristics, Humans",eng,Italy,,,,,,,,,195,203,,,,,,,2015-03,Published,,,,,,2016-10-18,,,,,,Heuristics: foundations for a novel approach to medical decision making.,Journal Article,,10,,,3,3,0,0,0,,,,,Internal and Emergency Medicine (1828-0447),0.776,No,,green,13/06/2017 03:06:58,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,25348561,PubMed,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Internal and Emergency Medicine,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

We measured impulsive decision-making in a cohort of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in which we had previously manipulated developmental telomere attrition by cross-fostering sibling chicks into broods of different sizes. We show that as predicted by state-dependent optimality models, individuals who had sustained greater developmental telomere attrition and who had shorter current telomeres made more impulsive foraging decisions as adults, valuing smaller, sooner food rewards more highly than birds with less attrition and longer telomeres.

Telomere attrition is a potentially important mechanism in such effects. One source of early-life adversity is the stress caused by competitive disadvantage. Although previous avian experiments suggest that competitive disadvantage may accelerate telomere attrition, they do not clearly isolate the effects of competitive disadvantage from other sources of variation. Here, we present data from an experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that used cross-fostering to expose siblings to divergent early experience. Birds were assigned either to competitive advantage (being larger than their brood competitors) or competitive disadvantage (being smaller than their brood competitors) between days 3 and 12 post-hatching. Disadvantage did not affect weight gain, but it increased telomere attrition, leading to shorter telomere length in disadvantaged birds by day 12. There were no effects of disadvantage on oxidative damage as measured by plasma lipid peroxidation. We thus found strong evidence that early-life competitive disadvantage can accelerate telomere loss. This could lead to faster age-related deterioration and poorer health in later life.

Women stated their preferences for sharing test results and selected the most likely follow-up action they would pursue in each of the test result scenarios (above average and below average risk for breast cancer). Four hundred seventy-eight women participated. Most women (89 %) did not know what a SNP was prior to the study. Once SNP testing was described, 75 % were interested in SNP testing. Participants stated an interest in lifestyle interventions for risk-reduction and wanted to discuss their testing results with their doctor or a genetic counselor.

Neuroeconomics strives to observe these values directly in the brain. A widely used valuation term in formal learning and decision-making models is the reward prediction error: the value of an outcome relative to its expected value. An influential theory (Holroyd & Coles, 2002) claims that an electrophysiological component, feedback related negativity (FRN), codes a reward prediction error in the human brain. Such a component should be sensitive to both the prior likelihood of reward and its magnitude on receipt. A number of studies have found the FRN to be insensitive to reward magnitude, thus questioning the Holroyd and Coles account. However, because of marked inconsistencies in how the FRN is measured, a meaningful synthesis of this evidence is highly problematic. We conducted a meta-analysis of the FRN's response to both reward magnitude and likelihood using a novel method in which published effect sizes were disregarded in favor of direct measurement of the published waveforms themselves, with these waveforms then averaged to produce ""great grand averages."" Under this standardized measure, the meta-analysis revealed strong effects of magnitude and likelihood on the FRN, consistent with it encoding a reward prediction error. In addition, it revealed strong main effects of reward magnitude and likelihood across much of the waveform, indicating sensitivity to unsigned prediction errors or ""salience."" The great grand average technique is proposed as a general method for meta-analysis of event-related potential (ERP).",,,,,,"Sambrook TD, Goslin J",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25495239,,,,,10.1037/bul0000006,,,1939-1455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Psychol Bull,"Data Interpretation, Statistical, Electroencephalography, Evoked Potentials, Feedback, Psychological, Humans, Reward",eng,United States,,,,,,,,,213,235,,,,,2014-54991-001,,2015-01,Published,,,,,,2016-09-29,,,,,,A neural reward prediction error revealed by a meta-analysis of ERPs using great grand averages.,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis",,141,,,61,58,38,58,8.941422,Psychological Bulletin (0033-2909),A*,,,Psychological Bulletin (0033-2909),8.041,No,,green,09/12/2017 21:43:23,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/9974,Yes,Live,12 months,25495239,PubMed,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Psychological Bulletin,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

In Experiment 1, messages were passed down chains of participants using five different modes of communication. Written communication channels resulted in more accurate message transmission than verbal. In addition, some elements of the message endured further down the chain than others. Experiment 2 largely replicated these effects and also demonstrated that simple repetition of a message eliminated differences between written and spoken communication. In a final field experiment, chains of participants passed information however they wanted to, with the proviso that half of the chains could not use telephones.

In Experiment 1, messages were passed down chains of participants using five different modes of communication. Written communication channels resulted in more accurate message transmission than verbal. In addition, some elements of the message endured further down the chain than others. Experiment 2 largely replicated these effects and also demonstrated that simple repetition of a message eliminated differences between written and spoken communication. In a final field experiment, chains of participants passed information however they wanted to, with the proviso that half of the chains could not use telephones.

Highly productive individuals, with high growth rates and high fecundity, are assumed to live life at a fast pace showing high levels of boldness and risk taking, compared with less productive individuals. Here, we investigate among-individual differences in mean boldness (the inverse of the latency to recover from a startling stimulus) and in the consistency of boldness, in male hermit crabs in relation to two aspects of life-history investment. We assessed aerobic scope by measuring the concentration of the respiratory pigment haemocyanin, and we assessed fecundity by measuring spermatophore size. First, we found that individuals investing in large spermatophores also had high concentrations of haemocyanin. Using doubly hierarchical-generalized linear models to analyse longitudinal data on startle responses, we show that hermit crabs vary both in their mean response durations and in the consistency of their behaviour. Individual consistency was unrelated to haemocyanin concentration or spermatophore size, but mean startle response duration increased with spermatophore size. Thus, counter to expectations, it was the most risk-averse individuals, rather than the boldest and most risk prone, that were the most productive. We suggest that similar patterns should be present in other species, if the most productive individuals avoid risky behaviour.

Very little work has investigated the effects of the associative history of outcomes on human learning. Three experiments extended the ""learned irrelevance"" paradigm from the animal conditioning literature to examine the influence of an outcome's prior predictability on subsequent learning of relationships between cues and that outcome. All 3 experiments found evidence for the idea that learning is biased by the prior predictability of the outcome. Previously predictable outcomes were readily associated with novel predictive cues, whereas previously unpredictable outcomes were more readily associated with novel nonpredictive cues. This finding highlights the importance of considering the associative history of outcomes, as well as cues, when interpreting multistage designs.

The present study expanded on this evidence by investigating the observational learning of visuospatial concepts from patterns of covariation across multiple exemplars. METHOD: Child and adult participants with ASD, and age-matched control participants, viewed multishape arrays composed from a random combination of pairs of shapes that were each positioned in a fixed spatial arrangement. RESULTS: After this passive exposure phase, a posttest revealed that all participant groups could discriminate pairs of shapes with high covariation from randomly paired shapes with low covariation. Moreover, learning these shape-pairs with high covariation was superior in adults with ASD than in age-matched controls, whereas performance in children with ASD was no different than controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend previous observations of visuospatial enhancement in ASD into the domain of learning, and suggest that enhanced visual statistical learning may have arisen from a sustained bias to attend to local details in complex arrays of visual features.",,,,,,"Roser ME, Aslin RN, McKenzie R, Zahra D, Fiser J",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25151115,,,,,10.1037/neu0000137,,,1931-1559,,"pmc:PMC4340818, nihms:NIHMS629003",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Neuropsychology,"Adolescent, Adult, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Child, Female, Humans, Language, Male, Memory, Short-Term, Middle Aged, Probability Learning",eng,United States,,,,,,,,,163,172,,,,,2014-35228-001,,2015-03,Published,,,,,,2016-03-23,,,,,,Enhanced visual statistical learning in adults with autism.,"Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,29,,,10,10,7,8,1.538123,Neuropsychology (0894-4105),A,,,Neuropsychology (0894-4105),1.127,No,,green,10/12/2017 00:43:44,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,25151115,PubMed,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Neuropsychology,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Explorative and bold behaviours often covary with contest behaviour and outcome, although there is evidence that the structure of these 'behavioural syndromes' can change across situations. Aggression itself is typically repeatable, but also subject to high within-individual variation as a consequence of plastic responses to previous fight outcomes and opponent traits. Common proximate mechanisms (gene expression, endocrine control and metabolic rates) may underpin variation in both contest behaviour and general personality traits.

Methods: We searched five electronic databases and reference lists to locate all eligible trials and analysed trial quality. Outcome measures were all-cause and cancer mortality, disease-free survival, second primary cancer, cancer and potentially malignant disorder recurrence and progression to cancer. Results of individual trials were combined by use of random-effects meta-analyses.
 Results & Conclusions: We identified 17 15 trials, eightnine in people with upper aerodigestive tract cancer and seven eight in people with potentially malignant disorders, respectively. The results provide little evidence that retinoids have a beneficial effect on disease-free survival (OR=0.74, 95% CI =0.51, 1.09), all cause mortality (OR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.00 to 1.65), disease-free survival (OR=0.74, 95% CI =0.51, 1.09), recurrence of cancer (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.95, 2.26), development of second primary cancers (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.76, 1.20) or the progression to malignancy (OR = 0.69, 95% CIs = 0.22, 2.15). There was even a suggestion of harm for some outcomes. There was also a suggestion that retinoids may decrease the recurrence of potentially malignant disorders (OR = 0.22, 95% CIs = 0.03, 1.34). For now there is no evidence to support the use of retinoids in people with upper aerodigestive tract cancer.",,,,,,"Norman AL, Perry R, Ness AR, Prime SS, Cole-Hawkins H, Thomas S",,,,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,Oral Surgery,,English,UK,,,,DOI:10.1111/ors.12134,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-12-08,Published,,British Association of Oral Surgeons,,,2015-04-07,,,,,,,Synthetic Retinoid Interventions and Outcomes in People with Cancer or Potentially Malignant Disorders of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,Article,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,Oral Surgery (1752-2471),0.21,No,,yellow,22/02/2018 01:59:28,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/3286,Yes,Live,Unknown,872AB706-79D7-427B-BDA4-7647B09C69FF,Manual,Crossref; Scopus,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,Oral Surgery,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Some individuals with visible differences have been found to experience psychosocial adjustment problems that can lead to social anxiety and isolation. Various models of psychosocial intervention have been used to reduce social anxiety and appearance related distress in this population. The objective of this review was to update a previous systematic review assessing the efficacy of psychosocial intervention programs for adults with visible differences. The original review (Bessell & Moss, 2007) identified 12 papers for inclusion.

Methods. A search protocol identified studies from 13 electronic journal databases. Methods: Studies were selected in accordance with pre-set inclusion criteria and relevant data were extracted.

Results. This update identified an additional four papers that met the inclusion criteria. Two papers provided very limited evidence for the efficacy of a combined cognitive-behavioural and social skills training approach. None of the papers provided sufficient evidence for the optimal duration, intensity or setting of psychosocial interventions for this population.

Discussion. The review concluded that a greater number of Randomised Controlled Trials and experimental studies were required to increase the methodological validity of intervention studies.",,,,,,"Norman AL, Moss TP",,,,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,PeerJ,,,,,,,e870,,,,,e870,,,,,,,,2015-04-02,,,,,,2015-04-07,,,,,,,Psychosocial interventions for adults with visible differences: a systematic review,Article,,,,,5,4,1,3,0.9805366,,,,,PeerJ (2167-8359),0.865,Yes,CC BY,green,26/06/2017 10:00:56,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/3288,Yes,Live,Unknown,79139BC0-F338-42F7-AC91-0F55F0AB3886,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,PeerJ,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Three-dimensional visual rendering software was employed to generate a total of 384 realistic-looking mental rotation stimuli with shading and foreshortening depth cues. Each stimulus was composed of two pictures: a baseline object and a target object, placed side by side, which can be aligned by means of a rotation around the vertical axis in half of the stimuli but not in the other half. Behavioral data (N=54, freely available) based on these stimuli exhibited the typical linear increase in response times and error rates with angular disparity, validating the stimulus set.

We tested whether male offenders who participate in alcohol treatment programs show lower rates of recidivism than a matched offender group who did not participate in an alcohol prevention program. METHODS: This is an observational matched case-control study. Participants were 564 male offenders with an alcohol problem related to offending. Participants were assigned by the courts to 1 of 3 alcohol treatment programs (141 offenders per treatment): Low Intensity Alcohol Program (LIAP), Alcohol Specified Activity Requirement, and Addressing Substance-Related Offending.

However, whether individuals exhibiting high scores on Dark Triad measures have a heightened deceptive ability has received little experimental attention. The present study tested whether the ability to lie effectively, and to detect lies told by others, was related to Dark Triad, Lie Acceptability, or Self-Deceptive measures of personality using an interactive group-based deception task. At a group level, lie detection accuracy was correlated with the ability to deceive others-replicating previous work. No evidence was found to suggest that Dark Triad traits confer any advantage either to deceive others, or to detect deception in others. Participants who considered lying to be more acceptable were more skilled at lying, while self-deceptive individuals were generally less credible and less confident when lying. Results are interpreted within a framework in which repeated practice results in enhanced deceptive ability.",,"Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London, London, WC1E 7HX, United Kingdom.",,,,"Wright GR, Berry CJ, Catmur C, Bird G",,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0127315,,,1932-6203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,PloS one,,eng,,Electronic-eCollection,,,,,,,,e0127315,e0127315,,,,,,,2015,,,,,,2015-07-17,,,,,,,Good Liars Are Neither 'Dark' Nor Self-Deceptive.,"Journal Article, Article",,10,,,6,5,1,1,0.2666713,PLoS One (1932-6203),A,,,PLoS ONE (1932-6203),1.092,Yes,CC BY,green,26/06/2017 09:53:24,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/3424,Yes,Live,Unknown,C97FA3C6-1C7A-4FFD-A512-5ADF4772E451,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,PLoS ONE,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Two sets of experiments explore these phenomena, using extensions of the standard unconscious plagiarism paradigm. In Experiment 1A participants worked together in same- or different-sex dyads before trying to recall their own ideas or their partner's ideas. More source errors were evident for same-sex dyads (Experiment 1A), but this effect was absent when participants recalled from both sources simultaneously (Experiment 1B). In Experiment 2A, participants recalled ideas from a single source either alone or in the presence of the partner, using an extended-recall task. Partner presence did not affect the availability of ideas, but did reduce the propensity to report them as task compliant, relative to a partner-present condition. Simultaneous recall from both sources removed this social effect (Experiment 2B).

Understanding the factors that drive their desire to eat is key to limiting their reactions to available food. This study tested whether individual differences in sensitivity to hedonic food cues are cognitively based and, accordingly, can be regulated by blocking cognitive resources. To this end, one lab study (study 1; N=91) and one field study (study 2; N=63) measured sensitivity to hedonic food cues using the Power of Food Scale (PFS; Lowe et al., 2009) and assessed participants’ appetitive responses to high-calorie food options. To test the role of cognitive elaboration of food cues, participants completed a menu-selection task to induce food cravings and then were free to elaborate those cravings (control group) or were blocked from doing so by cognitive distraction (solving puzzles, playing Tetris; experimental group). Compared to non-sensitive participants, sensitive participants displayed a greater attentional bias to high-calorie food (Study 1), reported stronger cravings (Study 2), and more often chose an unhealthy snack (Studies 1 & 2), but only when they had not been distracted. When distracted, all participants were similarly unresponsive to high-calorie food. This finding suggests that temptation can be effectively controlled by blocking people’s cognitive resources, even for people highly sensitive to hedonic food cues.",,,,,,"van Dillen L, Andrade J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Appetite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015-09-11,,,,,,2015-09-11,,,,,,,Derailing the streetcar named desire.

villosus is a highly predatory amphipod which has spread readily across Central Europe and recently the U.K. and its arrival has been associated
with the significant loss of resident species. Despite this, studies of its behavioural ecology are sparse, even though its behaviour may contribute
to its invasion success. For the first time we investigated anti-predator ‘fleeing’ behaviour in D. villosus and how this changed with water
temperature. Three key patterns emerged from our analysis. First, within a particular temperature condition there are moderate but consistent
among-individual differences in behaviour. These are driven by a combination of mean level among-individual differences and
within-individual relative consistency in behaviour, and provide the key marker for animal personalities. Second, the fleeing responses were
not influenced by temperature and thirdly, regardless of temperature, all individuals appeared to habituate to a repeated non-dangerous stimulus,
indicating a capacity for individual-learning. We suggest that the anti-predator behaviour of D. villosus contributes to its rapid spread and that
consistent among-individual differences in behaviour may promote biological invasions across heterogeneous conditions. Robustness to
changing water temperatures may also be potentially advantageous, particularly in an era of global climate change, where average temperatures could be elevated and less predictable",2015-04-07,,,,,"Briffa M, Jones N, MacNeil C",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Current Zoology,,,,,,,,,,,,45,51,,,,,,,2016-02-01,Published,,,Publisher's own licence,,2015-10-21,,,,,,,"Responses to threat in a freshwater invader: Longitudinal data reveal personality, habituation and robustness to changing water temperatures in the ‘killer shrimp’ Dikerogammarus villosus (Crustacea: Amphipoda).",Article,,62,,,1,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,No,,green,16/11/2017 20:40:15,2,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/4358,Yes,Live,Unknown,AC41E769-9275-4AB1-8969-A68C7B90B8FE,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Current Zoology,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Two hundred and fifty two young adults (125 female) completed measures of EI, Machiavellianism, managing the emotions of others (MEOS) and self-reported delinquent behaviour. High EI females presented higher levels of delinquency, Machiavellian Tactics and morality, the supposedly prosocial MEOS behaviours enhancing and diverting and the non-prosocial behaviours worsening, inauthenticity and concealing. High EI males reported fewer delinquent offences, high levels of MEOS prosocial enhancing behaviour and low levels of non-prosocial behaviours.

In mammals, the effects of social density have traditionally been considered a detrimental form of maternal stress. Now their potential adaptive significance is receiving greater attention.Sex-specific effects of maternal social instability on offspring in guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus) have been interpreted as adaptations to high social densities, while the effects of low social density are unknown. Hence, we compared morphological, behavioural and physiological development between offspring born to mothers housed either individually or in groups during the second half of pregnancy.Females housed individually and females housed in groups gave birth to litters of similar size and sex-ratios, and there were no differences in birth weight. Sons of individually-housed mothers grew faster than their sisters, whereas daughters ofgroup-housed females grew faster than their brothers, primarily due to an effect on growth of daughters. There were few effects on offspring behaviour. Baseline cortisol levels in saliva of pups on day 1 and day 7 were not affected, but we saw a blunted cortisol response to social separation on day 7 in sons of individually-housed females and daughters of group-housed females. The effects were consistent across two replicate experiments.The observed effects only partially support the adaptive hypothesis. Increased growth of daughters may be adaptive under high densities due to increasedfemale competition, but it is unclear why growth of sons is not increased under low social densities when males face less competition from older, dominant males. The differences in growth may be causally linked to sex-specific effects on cortisol response, although individual cortisol response and growth were not correlated, and various other mechanisms are possible. The observed sex-specific effects on early development are intriguing, yet the potential adaptive benefits and physiological mechanisms require further study.",2015-05-30,,,,,"von Engelhardt N, Kowalski GJ, Guenther A",,,,,,,,,1742-9994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers in zoology,,,,,,,,,,,,S13,S13,,,,,,,2015-08-24,,,,,,2016-06-17,,,,,,,"The maternal social environment shapes offspring growth, physiology, and behavioural phenotype in guinea pigs.",,,12 Suppl 1,,,4,3,0,2,0.3438976,Frontiers in Zoology (1742-9994),C,,,Frontiers in Zoology (1742-9994),1.233,Yes,CC BY,green,10/12/2017 06:49:53,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/4922,Yes,Live,No embargo,A1AA64DC-33AD-4D4D-B7CF-069274122B16,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Frontiers in Zoology,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

By showing that FIT can support change in eating behaviours, these findings show its potential as a motivational intervention for weight management.",2016-02-09,,,,,"Andrade J, Khalil M, Dickson J, May J, Kavanagh DJ",http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/jackie-andrade,,,,,10.1016/j.appet.2016.02.015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Appetite,"Cognitive, psychological, motivation, behaviour change, craving, snacking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-02-09,Accepted,,Elsevier,CC BY-NC-ND,,2016-02-17,,,,,,,Functional Imagery Training to reduce snacking: Testing a novel motivational intervention based on Elaborated Intrusion theory,Article,,,2017-02-11,,5,4,3,4,1.893722,Appetite (0195-6663),B,,,Appetite (0195-6663),1.384,No,,green,08/06/2018 00:16:19,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/4336,Yes,Live,12 months,0C30126B-D1B2-4CF6-89CE-BE596CAE8D6E,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Appetite,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Introduction: The Elaborated Intrusion Theory of Desire holds that desires for functional and dysfunctional goals share a common form. Both are embodied cognitive events, characterised by affective intensity and frequency. Accordingly, we developed scales to measure motivational cognitions for functional goals (Motivational Thought Frequency, MTF; State Motivation, SM), based on the existing Craving Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). When applied to increasing exercise, MTF and SM showed the same three-factor structure as the CEQ (Intensity, Imagery, Availability). The current study tested the internal structure and concurrent validity of the MTF and SM Scales when applied to control of alcohol consumption (MTF-A; SM-A). Methods: Participants (N = 417) were adult tertiary students, staff or community members who had recently engaged in high-risk drinking or were currently trying to control alcohol consumption. They completed an online survey comprising the MTF-A, SM-A, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ) and demographics. Results: Confirmatory Factor Analysis gave acceptable fit for the MTF-A, but required the loss of one SM-A item, and was improved by intercorrelations of error terms. Higher scores were associated with more severe problems on the AUDIT and with higher Contemplation and Action scores on the RCQ. Conclusions: The MTF-A and SM-A show potential as measures of motivation to control drinking. Future research will examine their predictive validity and sensitivity to change. The scales' application to both increasing functional and decreasing dysfunctional behaviours is consistent with EI Theory's contention that both goal types operate in similar ways.",,,,,,"Robinson N, Kavanagh D, Connor J, May J, Andrade J",,,,,,10.1016/j.addbeh.2016.02.038,,,1873-6327,,pubmed:26994467,,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4603,,Addictive Behaviors,,,,,,,,,,,,1,6,,,,,,,2016-08-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Assessment of motivation to control alcohol use: The motivational thought frequency and state motivation scales for alcohol control,Journal Article,,59,,,1,1,1,1,0.6077943,Addictive Behaviors (0306-4603),B,,,Addictive Behaviors (0306-4603),1.23,No,,green,08/06/2018 01:14:54,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/4521,Yes,Live,18 months,2-s2.0-84960843240,Scopus,Manual; Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Addictive Behaviors,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Children (4-, 5-, 6-7-, 8-9-, and 11-year-olds) and adults (N=282) viewed a map of a fictitious island containing various landmarks and two misleading signposts, indicating that some equidistant landmarks were different distances apart. Five-year-olds already revealed the linear time-distance scanning effect, previously shown in adults (Experiments 1 and 2): They took longer to mentally scan their image of the island with longer distances between corresponding landmarks, indicating the depictive format of children's mental images. Unlike adults, their scanning times were not affected by misleading top-down distance information on the signposts until age 8 (Experiment 1) unless they were prompted to the difference from the outset (Experiment 2). Findings provide novel insights into the format of children's mental images in a mental scanning paradigm and show that children's mental images can be susceptible to top-down influences as are adults'.",2016-05-23,,,,,"Wimmer MC, Maras KL, Robinson EJ, Thomas C",,,,,,,,,1873-7838,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0010-0277,,Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,2016-05-27,49,54,,,,,,,2016-09,,,,,,2016-06-08,,,,,,,The format of children's mental images: Evidence from mental scanning.,,,154,2017-05-27,,1,1,1,1,0.634272,Cognition (0010-0277),A*,,,Cognition (0010-0277),1.686,No,,green,07/06/2018 22:13:57,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/4857,Yes,Live,Unknown,D35FFA0A-9E7B-467D-AE30-C559613110ED,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Cognition,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

The work capitalises on primary data from a socio-technical household survey, undertaken in Plymouth, UK, during 2015, which was merged with building audit data collected by the social housing association managing the properties. The mean reported heating setpoint temperature was 20.9 °C and the average weekday and weekend day heating periods were 9.5 h and 11.2 h respectively. The results suggest that heating setpoint temperatures and periods vary greatly among UK social houses, but there are clear systematic variations according to dwelling, household, and motivation, behaviour and perception characteristics. The research could enable social housing providers, the government and commercial organisations to target energy efficiency measures (i.e. thermal upgrades) and social interventions (i.e. behaviour change) at those dwellings and households where their impact may be most beneficial. The results presented could also be used to better inform the assumptions of heating preferences in energy models, which could result in more realistic predictions of the space heating demands of social housing and the potential energy savings from refurbishment measures.",2016-06-02,,,,,"Jones RV, Fuertes A, Boomsma C, Pahl S",,,,,,10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.06.006,,,,,,,This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 649673.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy and Buildings,"Space heating preferences, Social housing, Socio-technical survey, Building audit, Heating setpoint temperature, Heating periods, Energy modelling",,,,,,,,,,2016-06-03,382,398,,,,,,,2016-09-01,,,Elsevier,CC BY-NC-ND,,2016-06-16,,,,,,,Space heating preferences in UK social housing: A socio-technical household survey combined with building audits,,,127,2017-06-03,,7,6,,,,Energy and Buildings (0378-7788),A*,,,Energy and Buildings (0378-7788),1.965,No,,green,08/06/2018 01:15:23,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/4914,Yes,Live,24 months,4A6E4E84-65AB-4DD5-90E3-5A8504250FF5,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Scopus,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,Energy and Buildings,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Social housing represents about 12% of the total European housing stock and therefore is a significant target for energy efficiency measures by governments of EU member states. This paper is aimed at exploring how an innovative serious game could contribute to energy consumption and carbon emissions reduction in social housing by increasing the social tenants’ understanding and engagement in energy efficiency. The proposed solution is being developed under the auspices of the EnerGAware project (Energy Game for Awareness of energy efficiency in social housing communities), funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme.",2016-09-08,,,,,"Casals M, Gangolells M, Macarulla M, Fuertes A, Jones R, Pahl S, Ruiz M",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-09-09,,,,,,,,,,,"Limassol, Cyprus",,11th European Conference on Product & Process Modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-09-08,Published,,,,,2016-09-14,,,,,2016-09-07,,Promoting energy users' behavioural change in social housing through a serious game,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/5447,Yes,Live,No embargo,5EF06B94-9D9A-4C9F-9113-F29266619437,Manual,Web of Science (Lite); Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,No

Purpose: There is a need for improved measurement of motivation for diabetes self-care. The Elaborated Intrusion Theory of Desire offers a coherent framework for understanding and identifying the cognitive-affective events that constitute the subjective experience of motivation and may therefore inform the development of such an instrument. Recent research has shown the resultant Motivation Thought Frequency scale (MTF) to have a stable factor structure (Intensity, Incentives Imagery, Self-Efficacy Imagery, Availability) when applied to physical activity, excessive snacking or alcohol use in the general population. The current study aimed to confirm the four-factor structure of the MTF for glucose testing, physical activity and healthy eating in people with type 2 diabetes. Associations with self-reports of concurrent diabetic self-care behaviours were also examined. Method: Confirmatory factor analyses tested the internal structure, and multiple regressions assessed the scale’s relationship with concurrent self-care behaviours. The MTF was completed by 340 adults with type 2 diabetes, and 237 from that sample also reported self-care behaviours. Separate MTFs assessed motivation for glucose testing, physical activity and healthy eating. Self-care was assessed using questions from the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities. Results: The MTF for each goal achieved an acceptable fit on all indices after selected errors within factors were allowed to intercorrelate. Intensity and Self-Efficacy Imagery provided the strongest and most consistent correlations with relevant self-care behaviours. Conclusion: Results provide preliminary support for the MTF in a diabetes sample. Testing of its sensitivity to change and its predictive utility over time is needed.",,,,,,"Parham SC, Kavanagh DJ, Gericke CA, King N, May J, Andrade J",,,,,,10.1007/s12529-016-9607-2,,,,,pubmed:27822664,,,,,,,,,,,,,1070-5503,3,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,447,456,,,,,,,2017-06-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,"Assessment of Motivational Cognitions in Diabetes Self-Care: the Motivation Thought Frequency Scales for Glucose Testing, Physical Activity and Healthy Eating",Journal Article,,24,,,0,,0,0,,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine (1070-5503),B,,,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine (1070-5503),0.971,No,,green,13/06/2017 02:06:53,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/6656,Yes,Live,12 months,2-s2.0-84994444314,Scopus,Manual; Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,International Journal of Behavioral Medicine,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

This paper describes the first phase of the EnerGAware project which aims to develop a serious game for social housing tenants in the UK. A survey was conducted to inform the design of the game, which investigated the relationship between psychological factors, context-specific factors (i.e. dwelling characteristics and monetary concerns), and energy saving behaviours. In total, 537 households completed a postal survey, with a response rate of 19.4%. The results showed that experiencing difficulty in keeping the home comfortably warm in winter related to behaviour. In particular, concerns about the affordability of heating seemed to be related to more frequent heating-related energy saving behaviours. Experiencing issues with overheating, damp, mould or condensation – and general concerns about energy bills, did not relate to energy saving behaviours. Overall, the psychological factors measured in the study related more strongly to energy saving behaviours; especially the ability to imagine energy use and strong social norms had a positive relationship with energy saving behaviour. The implications of the findings for the design of the serious game are discussed. Thus, the study uses a combined approach examining psychological and contextual factors to illustrate how important behavioural motivators relevant to a specific group of householders can be included in the design of an intervention.",2016-09-08,,,,,"Boomsma C, Jones RV, Pahl S, Fuertes A",,,,,,,,,,,,,The research reported in this paper was undertaken as part of the EnerGAware project: Energy Game for Awareness of energy efficiency in social housing communities.

Included are a large number of unpublished, newly discovered sites excavated through development-led projects. Data were also sourced from national archives, published excavation reports and on-line databases. Software tools were developed to deal with the varying nature and resolution of these datasets, allowing chronology to be considered in the analysis to a degree that is usually not possible in prehistoric studies. Summed radiocarbon probabilities are used to examine the dataset using context- and sample-sensitive approaches. Visualisations of spatial and chronological data illustrate the expansion of Early Neolithic settlement, followed by an apparent attenuation of all settlement activity. The Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods are characterised by a resurgence and diversification of activity. To assess the significance of these observations, Irish radiocarbon data are compared to an idealized model derived from North American data. Even after taking various considerations into account, human population increases can be suggested to have occurred during the Early and Late Neolithic periods. Gaps and biases in the data are discussed and priorities for future work are identified.",2016-06-10,,,,,"McLaughlin TR, Whitehouse NJ, Schulting RJ, McClatchie M, Barratt P, Bogaard A",,,,,,10.1007/s10963-016-9093-0,,,,,,,"Heritage Council, Republic of Ireland",,,,,,,,,,,,2,World Prehistory,,,,,,,,,,,,117,153,,,,,,,2016-06-10,Published,,,,,2014-07-01,,,,,,,The Changing Face of Neolithic and Bronze Age Ireland: A Big Data Approach to the Settlement and Burial Records,Article,,29,,,6,5,,,,Journal of World Prehistory (0892-7537),A,,,Journal of World Prehistory (0892-7537),1.566,No,,green,26/06/2017 09:47:51,2,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/5100,Yes,Live,No embargo,C89FB5DE-0436-434C-A594-E4167C4CEF37,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Scopus,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,No

Basic public health support for weight loss comprises information about healthy eating and lifestyle, but internet and mobile applications (apps) create possibilities for providing long-term motivational support. Aims To explore among people currently trying to lose wei ght, or maintaining weight loss, (i) problems, experiences and wishes in regards to weight management and weight loss support including e-health support; (ii) reactions to Functional Imagery Training (FIT) as a possible intervention. Method Six focus groups (Nï¿½=ï¿½24 in total) were recruited from a public pool of people who had expressed an interest in helping with research. The topics considered were barriers to weight loss, desired support for weight loss and acceptability of FIT including the FIT app. The focus group discussions were transcribed and thematically analysed. Results All groups spontaneously raised the issue of waning motivation and expressed the desire for motivational app support for losing weight and increasing physical activity. They disliked calorie counting apps and those that required lots of user input. All groups wanted behavioural elements such as setting and reviewing goals to be included, with the ability to personalise the app by adding picture reminders and choosing times for goal reminders. Participants were positive about FIT and FIT support materials. Conclusion There is a mismatch between the help provided via public health information campaigns and commercially available weight-loss self-help (lifestyle information, self-monitoring), and the help that individuals actually desire (motivational and autonomous e-support), posing an opportunity to develop more effective electronic, theory-driven, motivational, self-help interventions.",,,,,,"Solbrig L, Jones R, Kavanagh D, May J, Parkin T, Andrade J",,,,,,10.1016/j.invent.2016.12.003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2214-7829,,Internet Interventions,,,,,,,,,,,,23,31,,,,,,,2017-03-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,People trying to lose weight dislike calorie counting apps and want motivational support to help them achieve their goals,Journal Article,,7,,,4,,3,1,,,,,,Internet Interventions (2214-7829),1.116,No,,green,23/02/2018 09:08:26,2,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/8154,Yes,Live,No embargo,2-s2.0-85009902100,Scopus,Manual; Crossref; PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,Internet Interventions,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Scale length is a key barrier to more widespread application. A brief measure of alcohol craving is needed to improve research and treatment of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Grounded in the Elaborated Intrusion Theory of Desire, the Alcohol Craving Experience (ACE) Questionnaire comprises two 11-item self-report scales that assess past-week frequency and maximum strength of alcohol craving. This study aimed to create a brief version of the ACE while maintaining psychometric integrity and clinical utility. Methods: Patients attending a university hospital alcohol and drug outpatient service for the treatment of AUD completed the ACE as part of a questionnaire battery. Three patient samples were utilized: 519 patients with pretreatment and outcome data, 228 patients with pretreatment data, and 66 patients who completed the ACE at treatment sessions 1 and 2. Results: The Frequency scale of the ACE possessed greater clinical utility and predictive validity than the Strength scale. Revision of the Frequency measure produced a 5-item “Mini Alcohol Craving Experience” (MACE) Questionnaire. Satisfactory validity (construct, predictive, concurrent, convergent, and incremental) and reliability (internal and test–retest) were maintained. A 1 standard deviation increase in pretreatment MACE score was associated with a 54 percentage increase in the odds of patient lapse or dropout. Conclusions: The MACE provides a brief, theoretically, and psychometrically robust measure of alcohol craving suitable for use with AUD populations in time-limited clinical and research settings.",,,,,,"Coates JM, Gullo MJ, Feeney GFX, Kavanagh DJ, Young RMD, Dingle GA, May J, Andrade J, Statham DJ, Connor JP",,,,,,10.1111/acer.13278,,,1530-0277,,pubmed:28019645,,,,,,,,,,,,,0145-6008,1,Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,,,,,,,,,,,,156,164,,,,,,,2017-01-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,The Mini Alcohol Craving Experience Questionnaire: Development and Clinical Application,Journal Article,,41,,,1,1,1,1,,Alcoholism-Clinical and Experimental Research (0145-6008),B,,,Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research (0145-6008),0.992,No,,yellow,09/03/2018 22:58:24,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/8226,Yes,Live,Unknown,2-s2.0-85007591713,Scopus,Manual; Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Previous research has shown that it is causal of increased anxiety, lower social performance ratings and lower implicit self-esteem. Despite its prevalence, few studies have investigated this imagery directly. AIMS: This study aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of the phenomenology of negative imagery experienced by socially anxious individuals, and to compare recurrent and intrusive images with images deliberately generated by participants during the study. METHOD: Thirty-eight undergraduate students screened to be above average in social anxiety scores completed a computerized imagery questionnaire adapted from previous qualitative work. RESULTS: Thematic analyses revealed four major image themes for intrusive images and three for deliberately generated images including interacting with others and anxiety symptoms. Most intrusive images were based on negative episodic memories and were experienced at least fortnightly. Images were primarily visual, auditory and somatic but could involve any sensory modality. Depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21) scores were higher in participants who experienced intrusive imagery and increased with the frequency of intrusions. Emotionality was generally higher in intrusive images than generated images. CONCLUSIONS: The phenomenology of negative imagery experienced by socially anxious individuals is idiosyncratic and may be inherently different from images generated for use in experimental research. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.",2016-12-21,,,,,"Homer SR, Deeprose C",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193311,,,,,10.1017/S1352465817000017,,,1469-1833,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Behav Cogn Psychother,"Social anxiety, intrusive imagery, mental imagery, qualitative",,,,,,,,,,2017-02-16,1,15,,,,,,,2017-02-16,Published online,,,,,2017-02-16,,,,,,,Voluntary and Involuntary Imagery in Social Anxiety.,,,,2018-02-16,,1,1,0,0,,Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy (1352-4658),C,,,Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy (1352-4658),0.981,No,,green,10/03/2018 06:00:40,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/8516,Yes,Live,12 months,8CA7A404-EFE0-4FFF-9C17-003E810A7FE3,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

We investigated the sub-factors of trait EI: Wellbeing, Self-control, Emotionality, and Sociability, in the context of the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) of motivation. In Study 1, participants (N = 247) completed Carver and White’s (J Personal Soc Psychol 67:319–333; Carver, White, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 67:319–333, 1994) BIS/BAS scales and a measure of trait EI. All EI sub-factors were positively associated with BAS Drive and negatively with BIS. Study 2 (N = 382) employed a new questionnaire based on revised RST (Corr and Cooper, Psychol Assess 28:1427–1440; Corr, Cooper, Psychological Assessment 28:1427–1440, 2016). All trait EI factors were positively associated with BAS Goal-Drive Persistence and Reward Interest, and negatively with the BIS. Self-control showed negative associations with BAS Impulsivity and was the only factor not to correlate with BAS Reward Reactivity. Results suggest that high trait EI individuals are goal driven, sensitive to reward and lower in avoidance motivation and negative emotion.

Adults (N = 315) received an ego depletion task and were subsequently tested on their inhibitory control abilities that were indexed by the Stroop task (Experiment 1) and their ability to perceive both interpretations of ambiguous figures that was indexed by reversal (Experiment 2). Ego depletion had a very small effect on reducing inhibitory control (Cohen's d = .15) (Experiment 1). Ego-depleted participants had a tendency to take longer to respond in Stroop trials. In Experiment 2, ego depletion had small to medium effects on the experience of reversal. Ego-depleted viewers tended to take longer to reverse ambiguous figures (duration to first reversal) when naïve of the ambiguity and experienced less reversal both when naïve and informed of the ambiguity. Together, findings suggest that ego depletion has small effects on inhibitory control and small to medium effects on bottom-up and top-down perceptual processes.

Based on previous findings from adults and ageing populations, the key question was whether they develop as a set of related abilities and become increasingly differentiated or are unrelated abilities per se. Findings revealed that both mental scanning and rotation abilities develop between 4- and 6 years of age. Specifically, 4-year-olds showed no difference in accuracy of mental scanning and no scanning trials whereas all older children and adults made more errors in scanning trials. Additionally, the minority of 4-year-olds showed a linear increase in response time with increasing rotation angle difference of two stimuli in contrast to all older participants. Despite similar developmental trajectories, mental scanning and rotation performances were unrelated. Thus, adding to research findings from adults, mental scanning and rotation appear to develop as a set of unrelated abilities from the outset.

Young children sometimes make serious attempts to perform impossible actions on miniature objects as if they were full-size objects. The existing explanations of these curious action errors assume (but never explicitly tested) children's decreased attention to object size information. This study investigated the attention to object size information in scale errors performers. Two groups of children aged 18–25 months (N = 52) and 48–60 months (N = 23) were tested in two consecutive tasks: an action task that replicated the original scale errors elicitation situation, and a looking task that involved watching on a computer screen actions performed with adequate to inadequate size object. Our key finding − that children performing scale errors in the action task subsequently pay less attention to size changes than non-scale errors performers in the looking task −suggests that the origins of scale errors in childhood operate already at the perceptual level, and not at the action level.",,,,,,"Grzyb BJ, Cangelosi A, Cattani A, Floccia C",,,,,,10.1016/j.infbeh.2017.03.001,,,1934-8800,,pubmed:28347908,,,,,,,,,,,,,0163-6383,,Infant Behavior and Development,,,,,,,,,,,,72,82,,,,,,,2017-05-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Decreased attention to object size information in scale errors performers,Journal Article,,47,,,0,,0,0,,Infant Behavior and Development (0163-6383),B,,,Infant Behavior and Development (0163-6383),0.999,No,,green,08/06/2018 00:15:51,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/9240,Yes,Live,No embargo,2-s2.0-85016078948,Scopus,Manual; Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Infant Behavior and Development,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Research in robotics has made available numerous possibilities and tools for further innovation in the psychological practice. For instance, recent research provided many examples of possible applications of robots in the education and rehabilitation of people with learning difficulties and/or intellectual disabilities. In this paper, we present a study on how cultural backgrounds can influence the perception and intention to use a robot as an instrument in the future practice. The study involved 37 Italian students and 37 UK students, as future professionals in the field of psychology, which experienced the actual capabilities of a humanoid robot through a live demo. In this work, we explored the main factors of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with the aim to reveal cultural differences. The instrument used was the UTAUT questionnaire, which was designed and validated to investigate the robot acceptance and use. A significant difference on the intention to use the robot is reported in our results.

All rights reserved. Decisions made in later life can dramatically impact older adults' health and financial well-being. Using Medicare Part D as a real-life decision-making example, this chapter aims to illustrate factors that may impact older adults' decision-making ability, with a particular focus on choice set size preferences. Dual-process perspectives suggest that older adults should perform worse on deliberative tasks, particularly when they are cognitively demanding. Consistent with this view, it is not surprising that more options do not always contribute to better decision making among older adults. Older adults also prefer fewer options when explicitly asked, and that preference is mediated by cognitive abilities. Other factors, such as numeracy and personality, are also discussed as potential influences on choice preferences both across and within age groups. We conclude by making suggestions for policy change based on the reviewed empirical work.",,,,,,"Liu PJ, Wood S, Hanoch Y",,,,,,10.1016/B978-0-12-417148-0.00015-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9780124171558,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,309,327,,Aging and Decision Making: Empirical and Applied Perspectives,,,,,2015-02-23,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Chapter 15 - Choice and Aging: Less is More.

Additionally, other housing problems such as damp are common. Previous research has found a link between housing problems and poor health and reduced well-being, but this relationship is complex and poorly understood. A survey among UK social housing residents (N=536) investigated the association between cold and damp housing, as well as the role of energy affordability concerns in the relationship between housing problems and health. The findings indicated that struggles with keeping warm related to a cluster of damp and mould issues rather than any one specific issue. In describing these problems householders expressed a sense of frustration and helplessness. Support was found for an indirect effect on health whereby households experiencing cold, damp or mould issues reported more difficulty with affording their energy bills, these affordability concerns in turn related to poor health and well-being. The effects were found to be more consistent and stronger for men compared to women. Policies aimed at reducing housing problems should consider the important role of affordability concerns and the need for households to regain control of their energy bills.",2017-04-05,,,,,"Boomsma GT, Pahl S, Jones RV, Fuertes A",,,,,,10.1016/j.enpol.2017.04.011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0301-4215,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,2017-04-12,382,393,,,,,,,2017-07,,,Elsevier,,,2017-04-26,,,,,,,"“Damp in bathroom.

All rights reserved. Satellite monitoring and control systems provide the possibility for audible alarms to signal system events that require operators to pay attention and eventually to take action. The audible alarms that are currently in use at ESA control areas are very basic and unfortunately non-discriminating with respect to the events they are signalling. These audible alarms consist of sound files often arbitrarily fished out from the Internet; thus, when they sound they convey no added information about the event that caused it. No considerations whatsoever are made concerning their suitability, ergonomic aspects, or effects of such alarms on operators working on long shifts. Because sounds are prompting a much faster reaction from operators than visual cues, when used efficiently they can also be made to establish criticality, urgency, origin or expected action (think for example on your car alarm that tells you to buckle up or that you are about to bump the car behind you). This paper describes the work performed together with Delft University of Technology and the University of Plymouth to analyse the satellite monitoring problem, to define a sound alarm philosophy that foresees different levels of urgency/criticality associated with typical operator actions based on contextual enquiry in the field, and the corresponding implementation of a library of coherent sounds that include 3 themes of 5 sounds each that map to the levels defined. It will also describe the evaluation of the sounds with operators and how the Cluster mission is implementing a solution to deploy this alarm philosophy and sounds in its dedicated control area, making sure to analyse evolution of operator behaviour before and after the deployment.",,,,,,"Sousa B, Donati A, Özcan E, Van Egmond R, Jansen R, Edworthy J, Peldszus R, Voumard Y",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9781624104268,,,,,,"14th International Conference on Space Operations, 2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Designing and deploying meaningful auditory alarms for control systems,Conference Proceeding,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,2-s2.0-84980024578,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,No

All rights reserved. Clinical alarm plays a critical role to alert clinician to situations that require urgent response. However, alarms are often ignored or switched off. The objectives of the study are to identify how clinicians responded to user response, propose response time and recommend improvements to the clinical alarm performance. A focus group was commissioned to identify the high and medium risk based alarm conditions and propose appropriate response time. A survey was carried out in Malaysia with 324 clinicians, 279(86.1%) were registered nurses and medical assistants (MA) and 45(13.9%) were medical doctors. The findings show that 16.0% of the respondents switched off the alarm, 20.4% silenced the alarm, 14.5% delayed to respond and 20% ignored the alarm. The findings indicate 78.1% of the respondent recommended less than 10sec for ‘immediate respond’ for high risk alarm, 72.5% recommended less than 60sec for ‘prompt respond’ for medium risk alarms but49% recommended that delayed respond for low risk alarm should not be specified. This will then reduce the number of alarms and workload in ICU/CCU. The key recommendation that has been proposed to improve clinical alarm performance is to ensure the alarm signal to indicate urgency to respond. The incorporation of the response time based on risk in the design of alarm, to indicate urgency to respond in auditory alarm signal can improve user response and patient safety.",,,,,,"Thangavelu S, Ifeachor E, Yunus J, Edworthy J",,,,,,10.5013/IJSSST.a.16.04.01,,,1473-804X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1473-8031,4,"International Journal of Simulation: Systems, Science and Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,1.1,1.9,,,,,,,2015-08-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Improving alarm response in ICU/CCU,Journal Article,,33,,,0,,,,,,,,,"International Journal of Simulation: Systems, Science and Technology (1473-8031)",0.047,Yes,,none,,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,2-s2.0-84961839670,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,"International Journal of Simulation : Systems, Science and Technology",DOAJ,No

This review identified eleven peer-reviewed articles on behavioral impacts of noise on aquatic crustaceans, examining one freshwater species and several marine species, of which all are decapod crustaceans. Research incorporated noise sources such as low-frequency pile driving and airgun exploitation for seismic surveys, ship, and boat noise as well as white noise and pure tones. The studies suggest a variety of biological and ecological impacts ranging from increase in some behaviors (for instance locomotion) and stress, reduced and slower antipredator behavior, changes in foraging, suppressed behaviors with an ecological function (bioirrigation), and changes to intraspecific behavior (for instance agonistic encounters). More research on crustaceans and clearer reporting on the methods used to expose them to noise during experiments are needed. This would allow for consistent methods and ready comparison of results across studies.",,,,,,"Tidau S, Briffa M",,,,,,10.1121/2.0000302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1939-800X,1,Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-07-10,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Review on behavioral impacts of aquatic noise on crustaceans,Conference Proceeding,,27,,,1,,,,,,,,,Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics (1939-800X),0.124,No,,yellow,22/02/2018 10:01:54,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,2-s2.0-85011024384,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

All rights reserved. Fighting behaviour is a key determinant of an individual's ability to access critical resources available in limited supply and evolutionary game theory was first developed for the analysis of animal contests. Early models such as the Hawk-Dove game demonstrated how selection could favour the use of non-injurious fight activities such as agonistic signals. Subsequent theoretical developments proposed specific adaptive benefits, so called 'assessment rules', for these agonistic behaviours. Essentially, these are assumptions about how the signal might induce the opponent to decide to leave the contest or 'give up'. Moreover, these models make predictions about how agonistic signals should vary in intensity as the contest progresses and how contest intensity and giving up decisions should be related to the time and energy costs associated with performing the signal. Empirical studies have to a certain extent lagged behind the theoretical advances, but recent work has attempted to address this through quantification of the energetic consequences of fighting coupled with detailed ethological analyses of agonistic signals. Furthermore, a parallel body of work has investigated the links between whole body performance capacities and fighting success, addressing issues such as the role of stamina in contests, which are central to theory. In this chapter I aim to synthesise these two strands of work looking into the proximate mechanisms of aggression, and to delineate what they can tell us about the adaptive value of sexually and naturally selected agonistic signals. A key term used by both approaches is 'performance' but the precise meaning of this varies between studies. In studies focussed on testing the theoretical assessment rules 'performance' relates to an individual's production of a dynamic signal during the encounter; these performances are energetically demanding during the time scale of the encounter and these demands may be the basis of giving up decisions. In studies concerned with the relationships between whole body performance capacities and, usually postural, agonistic signals 'performance' relates to the ability of an individual to perform some task outside of an agonistic encounter. In this chapter 'performance' is used to describe both properties as appropriate. By assessing the current state of knowledge from both approaches I will suggest possible future directions for theoretical and empirical studies of agonistic signals.",,,,,,Briffa M,,,,,,10.1002/9781118966624.ch6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9781118966624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,141,173,,Animal Signaling and Function: An Integrative Approach,,,,,2015-01-20,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Agonistic Signals: Integrating Analysis of Functions and Mechanisms,Chapter,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,2-s2.0-84926130917,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,No

The diversity of animal signals has been widely documented, and the generality of animal signals also tantalizingly suggests that there are common mechanisms that have selected for their origin. However, while much progress has been made on some fronts, we still lack a general theory about why the diversity of signaling structures exist. Our compilation will directly address this gap by focusing on an exciting new arena of sexual selection, namely using functional approaches to understand signaling. This approach is rooted in the idea that many signals are designed to transmit important functional imformation that is both important for issues of male quality (and hence male competition), and female choice. The increasing use of technology in sexual selection studies has enabled researchers to test whether signaling is either constrained by, or accurately transmits information about functional capacities. Further, in animals that fight vigorously, functional capacities such as endurance or strength may make the difference between winning and losing. This volume brings together a diverse collection of researchers who are actively investigating how function and signaling are related. These researchers use both a variety of methods and taxa to study animal signaling, and we believe that this integrative view is important to open up fresh vistas for why animal signals have evolved.",,,,,,"Irschick DJ, Briffa M, Podos J",,,,,,10.1002/9781118966624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9781118966624,,,,,,Animal Signaling and Function: An Integrative Approach,,,,,,,,,,,,1,260,,,,,,,2015-01-20,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Animal Signaling and Function: An Integrative Approach,Book,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,2-s2.0-84926095771,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,No

Research so far has focused on assessing the determinants of such attributions in static contexts, very often in the form of questionnaires, and not much is known about their dynamics, in particular, how direct experience of behaviour over time influences the interpretation of vocal characteristics. We used the investment game, an innovative methodology adapted from game theory studies, to assess how trust attributions – to virtual players acting more or less cooperatively – are affected by the prosodic characteristics of speakers of a range of British English accents. Regression analysis shows that speaker accent, mean pitch, and articulation rate all influence participants investment decisions, our implicit measure of trust. Furthermore, participants interpretations of these prosodic characteristics interact with how the virtual players behave over time.

Bayesian analyses of palaeoenvironmental and archaeological 14C data have allowed us to re-examine evidential strands within a strong chronological framework. While the nature and timing of the very beginning of the Neolithic in Ireland is still debated, our results – based on new Bayesian chronologies of plant macro-remains – are consistent with a rapid and abrupt transition to agriculture from c. 3750 cal BC, though there are hints of earlier Neolithic presence at a number of sites. We have emphatically confirmed the start of extensive Neolithic settlement in Ireland with the existence of a distinct ‘house horizon’, dating to 3720-3620 cal BC, lasting for up to a century. Cereals were being consumed at many sites during this period, with emmer wheat dominant, but also barley (naked and hulled), as well as occasional evidence for einkorn wheat, naked wheat and flax. The earliest farmers in Ireland, like farmers elsewhere across NW Europe, were not engaged in shifting cultivation, but practised longer-term fixed-plot agriculture. The association between early agriculture and the Elm Decline seen in many pollen diagrams shows that this latter event was not synchronous across all sites investigated, starting earlier in the north compared with the west, but that there is a strong coincidence with early agriculture at many sites. After this early boom, there are changes in the nature of settlement records; aside from passage tombs, the evidence for activity between 3400-3100 cal BC is limited. From 3400 cal BC, we see a decrease in the frequency of cereal evidence and an increase in some wild resources (e.g. fruits, but not nuts, in the records), alongside evidence for re-afforestation in pollen diagrams (3500–3000 cal BC). Changes occur at a time of worsening climatic conditions, as shown in Irish bog oak and reconstructed bog surface wetness records, although the links between the various records, and assessment of causes and effects, will require further investigation and may prove complex. This period seems to have been one of environmental, landscape, settlement and economic change. The later 4th millennium BC emerges as a period that would benefit from focused research attention, particularly as the observed changes in Ireland seem to have parallels in Britain and further afield.",2013-08-07,,,,,"Whitehouse NJ, Schulting RJ, McClatchie M, Barratt P, McLaughlin TR, Bogaard A, Colledge S, Marchant R, Gaffrey J, Bunting MJ",,,,,,10.1016/j.jas.2013.08.009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-4403,,Journal of Archaelogical Science,"Neolithic Ireland &amp; Britain, early agriculture, archaeobotany, pollen, palaeoecology, C14 dating, Bayesian chronologies, Neolithic rectangular houses, Neolithic settlement, Elm Decline, Plantago lanceolata, Neolithic environmental change, human adaptation &amp; resilience",,,,,,,,,,,181,205,,,,,,,2014-11-01,,,,,,2013-09-06,,,,,,,Neolithic agriculture on the European western frontier: the boom and bust of early farming in Ireland,Article,,51,,,47,47,,,,Journal of Archaeological Science (0305-4403),A*,,,Journal of Archaeological Science (0305-4403),1.508,No,,green,08/06/2018 01:14:50,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,919E85E0-E28A-4321-8C0E-50E1BBD70CFC,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Scopus,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,Journal of Archaeological Science,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

METHODS: Four novel PBL cases were designed and implemented, based on educational theory and evidence. Eight focus groups were undertaken with Year-1 and -2 students (n = 18) and PBL facilitators (n = 14) to explore the experiences of participants. Thematic analysis and conceptual abstraction led to insights into the intended and unintended consequences of the change. RESULTS: Participant responses to the change process were influenced by the perceived relevance and value of the change (e.g. benefit to student learning), which was shaped by individual beliefs and preferences (e.g. presumed purpose of PBL, relative value placed on different curriculum topics, and desire for uniform educational experience), and the wider education context (e.g. expectations of assessment). It appears that the three distinct elements must align for the changes to be received positively. We updated our PBL curriculum in response to new evidence DISCUSSION: This study describes how we updated our PBL curriculum in response to new evidence, and demonstrates the importance of communicating the pedagogic rationale behind changes, and meticulous planning, preparation and alignment, even in distant parts of the curriculum.

This intention-action prediction effect is explained by predictive perception models, wherein sensory input is interpreted in light of expectancies. This study altered the precision of the prediction by varying the predictability of the action from the intention, to increase/decrease the predictive perceptual bias. Participants heard an actor state an intention (""I'll take it""/""I'll leave it"") before the actor reached or withdrew from an object, thus confirming or contradicting the intention. The intention was predictive of the action (75% congruency) for one group and counterpredictive (25%) for another. The action disappeared midmovement and participants estimated the disappearance position. The intention-action prediction effect was greater if the intention was predictive than if counterpredictive. However, participants needed to explicitly know the predictability rates (Experiments 1 and 3). No group differences emerged when both groups believed the intention was nonpredictive (Experiment 2a), nor when a nonpredictive intention was believed to be (counter)predictive (Experiment 2b). The perception of others behavior is determined by its predictability from their intentions, and the precision of our social predictions is adapted to individual differences in behavior.

Six of the participants completed the workshop in an urban setting to offer a direct comparison between that and a natural setting of a woodland, with the phenomenon of biophilia taken into consideration.  Due to the personal circumstances of nine participants, another course took place in a semi urban indoor environment.

This study evaluates the influence of maternal age and government funding on obstetrician/gynecologist recommendation for invasive prenatal testing (i.e. amniocentesis) for Down syndrome (DS), and its association with the physician's assessment of the risk of liability for medical malpractice unless they recommend amniocentesis. Israeli physicians (N = 171) completed a questionnaire and provided amniocentesis recommendations for women at 18 weeks gestation with normal preliminary screening results, identical except aged 28 and 37. Amniocentesis recommendations were reversed for the younger ('yes' regardless of testing results: 6.4%; 'no' regardless of testing results: 31.6%) versus older woman ('yes' regardless of testing results: 40.9%; 'no' regardless of testing results: 7.0%; χ(2) = 71.55, p < .01). About half of the physicians endorsed different recommendations per scenario; of these, 65.6% recommended amniocentesis regardless of testing results for the 37-year-old woman. Physicians routinely performing amniocentesis and those advocating for amniocentesis for all women ≥ age 35 were approximately twice as likely to vary their recommendations per scenario. Physicians who perceived risk of liability for malpractice as large were nearly one-and-a-half times more likely to vary recommendations. The results indicate physicians' recommendations are influenced by maternal age, though age is already incorporated in prenatal DS risk evaluations. The physician's assessment of the risk that they will be sued unless they recommend amniocentesis may contribute to this spurious influence.",2017-05-30,,,,,"Miron-Shatz T, Rapaport SR, Srebnik N, Hanoch Y, Rabinowitz J, Doniger GM, Levi L, Rolison JJ, Tsafrir A",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616831,,,,,10.1007/s10897-017-0120-9,,,1573-3599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J Genet Couns,"Amniocentesis, Bias, Clinician recommendation, Decision making, Defensive medicine, Funding policy, Maternal age, Prenatal testing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-06-14,Published online,,,,,2017-10-05,,,,,,,"Invasive Prenatal Diagnostic Testing Recommendations are Influenced by Maternal Age, Statistical Misconception and Perceived Liability.",,,,2018-06-18,,0,,0,0,,Journal of Genetic Counseling (1059-7700),C,,,Journal of Genetic Counseling (1059-7700),0.889,No,,green,13/06/2017 02:06:40,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10011,Yes,Live,Unknown,020ABBE0-1477-43FA-A253-A01008A68748,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Journal of Genetic Counseling,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

We show how conceptualisations and proposed solutions to alarm fatigue are unequally distributed across what could be called the ‘alarm chain’: a generic model of the core structural elements and dynamic relations that constitute any alarm scenario. A focal point in the alarm chain – the ‘alarm mediation cleft’ – seems to divide the alarm fatigue literature from the segment of the alarm literature that deals with auditory alarm design. The current healthcare discourse on alarm fatigue is centred around the ‘premediated alarm phase’, which has the consequence of an unfortunate dichotomous approach to the functionality of sound. We address some shortcomings of this approach and outline some methodological implications and potentials of searching for signs of alarm fatigue in the ‘post-mediated alarm phase’.",2016-08-15,,,,,"Edworthy J, Kristensen M, Ozcan E",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1904-500X,1,Sound Effects,,,,,,,,,,,,88,104,,,,,,,2017-04-28,,,,,,2017-06-27,,,,,,,Alarm fatigue in the ward,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,grey,26/06/2017 10:12:11,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/9553,Yes,Live,Unknown,5D35D828-D0B1-4977-8BCF-62FF74AEFD16,Manual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,SoundEffects,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

All rights reserved. Satellite monitoring and control systems provide the possibility for audible alarms to signal system events that require operators to pay attention and eventually to take action. The audible alarms that are currently in use at ESA control areas are very basic and unfortunately non-discriminating with respect to the events they are signalling. These audible alarms consist of sound files often arbitrarily fished out from the Internet; thus, when they sound they convey no added information about the event that caused it. No considerations whatsoever are made concerning their suitability, ergonomic aspects, or effects of such alarms on operators working on long shifts. Because sounds are prompting a much faster reaction from operators than visual cues, when used efficiently they can also be made to establish criticality, urgency, origin or expected action (think for example on your car alarm that tells you to buckle up or that you are about to bump the car behind you). This paper describes the work performed together with Delft University of Technology and the University of Plymouth to analyse the satellite monitoring problem, to define a sound alarm philosophy that foresees different levels of urgency/criticality associated with typical operator actions based on contextual enquiry in the field, and the corresponding implementation of a library of coherent sounds that include 3 themes of 5 sounds each that map to the levels defined. It will also describe the evaluatio n of the sounds with operators and how the Cluster mission is implementing a solution to deploy this alarm philosophy and sounds in its dedicated control area, making sure to analyse evolution of operator behaviour before and after the deployment.",,,,,,"Sousa B, Donati A, Özcan E, van Egmond R, Jansen R, Edworthy J, Peldszus R, Voumard Y",,,,,,10.2514/6.2016-2616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9781624104268,,,,,,SpaceOps 2016 Conference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Designing and deploying meaningful auditory alarms for control systems,Conference Proceeding,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,No,Not deposited,Unknown,2-s2.0-85020528729,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,No

While the mentioned sub-parts have been subjects of discussion across a number of research areas, so far the fields have not tackled the combined concept with great success. In part this is attributed to a missing methodological approach. CogNovo, a doctoral training centre at Plymouth University, is set up in a way that it provides access to 25 PhD students and their supervisors practising cognitive innovation in their work across disciplines (Maranan, Loesche, & Denham, 2015). Here we show the elements of the setup with input, process, and output specified. We suggest a mixed methods approach to understand cognitive innovation as more than the sum of

Three experiments examined this phenomenon, using an outcome-selective Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) design and an outcome devaluation procedure. In Experiment 1, participants learned to perform one response to earn crisps points and another response to earn popcorn points. One outcome was then devalued by adulterating it to make it taste unpleasant. On test, overall response choice was biased toward the outcome that had not been devalued, indicating goal-directed control. Stimuli that signaled crisps and popcorn also biased instrumental response choice toward their respective outcomes (a PIT effect). Most importantly, the strength of this bias was not influenced by the devaluation manipulation. In contrast, Experiment 2 demonstrated that when stimuli signaled equal probability of the two outcomes, cue-elicited response choice was sensitive to the devaluation manipulation. Experiment 3 confirmed this conclusion by demonstrating a selective avoidance of the cued, devalued outcome. Together, these data support a goal-directed model of PIT in which expected outcome probability and value make independent contributions to response choice.

OBJECTIVES: The Department of Health and National Institute for Health Research are committed to involving patients in improving clinical education, research and service delivery. Yet, there is a limited body of evidence on the perceptions of patients when asked to be involved in this way, and specifically when asked to provide feedback on the communication skills of dental students. This study seeks to address this gap and heighten the understanding of the issues faced by patients when asked to be involved in clinical education. METHODS: Data were collected using focus groups with dental students (n=10) and patients (n=8) being treated by these students. Both groups were asked about their thoughts, feelings and beliefs about patients being asked to provide feedback on the communication skills of dental students. Data analysis involved inductive thematic analysis of transcribed audio recordings. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the data: ""legitimacy,"" ""co-educators,"" ""maintaining the equilibrium of the patient-student relationship"" and the ""timing of patient feedback."" Support for involving patients in giving feedback on students' communication skills was established, with patients considering they were best placed to comment on the communication skills of dental students. Patients and students do not want to provide feedback alone and want support to assist them, especially if feedback was negative. Issues of anonymity, confidentiality and ownership of the feedback process were worrisome, and the positioning of patient feedback in the programme was seen as critical. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and students are willing to engage in patient feedback on students' communication skills, and with support and training, the concerns around this are not insurmountable and the benefits could potentially profit both groups. These findings have resonance with other healthcare educators when using patients as educators in the development of communication skills.",2017-06-13,,,,,"Coelho C, Pooler J, Lloyd H",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714531,,,,,10.1111/eje.12282,,,1600-0579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European Journal of Dental Education,"clinical education, communication skills, dentistry, patients",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-07-17,Published online,,,,,2017-08-14,,,,,,,Using patients as educators for communication skills: Exploring dental students' and patients' views.,,,,2018-07-17,,0,,1,1,,European Journal of Dental Education (1396-5883),C,,,European Journal of Dental Education (1396-5883),0.997,No,,yellow,10/03/2018 06:02:05,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/9824,Yes,Live,No embargo,BCC9D066-13BB-4F19-A528-09D4743E2056,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,European Journal of Dental Education,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

On our crowded roads, drivers must compete for space but cooperate to avoid occupying the same space at the same time. Decision-making is strategic and requires mutual understanding of other’s choices. Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) will need risk management software to make these types strategic decisions without human arbitration. Accidents will occur, and what constitutes rational and ‘safe’ decisions will be scrutinized by the legal system. It is far from clear how AV-Human and AV-AV interactions should be managed. Game Theory provides a framework for analyzing mutual ‘games’ with 2 or more players. It assumes that players mutually optimize their outcomes according to Nash equilibria (NE), but do humans follow Nash equilibria in Human-Human interactions? We implemented simple two-player competitive games to see whether people played rationally according to Nash equilibria. On each of 100 trials, each player was instructed to maximise their reward by pressing one of three buttons labelled “4”, “6”, and “12”, without knowing the other players choice. If players pressed different buttons, they received a reward of 4, 6, or 12 points accordingly. If players pressed the same button, the reward was reduced depending on the game type. Results showed that players did not follow NE, but played a probabilistic game that included the “4” button, even though pressing this button is always suboptimal. We suggest that this may be an evolutionary strategy, but it clearly shows that people do not follow the ‘rational’ Nash strategy. It seems that AV-human interactions will be probabilistic. In AV-AV interactions, software may be playing itself, and may also require probabilistic optimal evolutionary-type strategies. We doubt that the full implications of autonomous decision-making have been fully worked out. Whether probabilistic decisions will tolerated legally and actuarially is doubtful. One way to avoid them would be to allow regulated AV-AV communications, and force software decisions to be deterministic according to some protocol. However, AV-Human interactions seem likely to remain problematic.",2017-04-28,,,,,Harris CM,,,,,,10.1007/978-3-319-64107-2_25,,,1611-3349,,,,,,,,,,,9783319641065,,,,0302-9743,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,,,,,,,,,,315,324,,,,,,,2017-07-20,Published,,,,,2017-10-24,,,,,,,Autonomous vehicle decision-making: Should we be bio-inspired?,,,10454 LNAI,,,0,,,,,,,,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (0302-9743),0.552,No,,green,09/03/2018 23:58:41,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10036,Yes,Live,Unknown,C9AC4FE9-CBD9-4999-B144-4F985538295D,Manual,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Previous studies have shown that both the repeatability of boldness and mean-level boldness can be affected by fighting experience and that these effects are strongest in the recipients of agonistic behaviour. However, whether these postfight changes in boldness impact future contest success and whether subsequent contests further affect boldness remain unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the effects of the specific tactics used within a fight (within-fight experience) and how these might influence future fight performance and boldness. Here, we investigated the relationship between fighting success and boldness (measured as recovery time when startled) across repeated contests in the beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina, measuring boldness on five occasions before, between and after two contests. We found that boldness (both repeatability and mean-level) was generally robust to the effects of fighting experience, apart from a decrease in the immediate boldness of losers after their second fight. Furthermore, we found that while prefight boldness significantly predicted fighting success and the level of aggression used in an individual's first fight, it did not predict victory or aggression in the second fight. Our findings thus indicate that different traits may be important in determining fighting success in consecutive fights and, moreover, that fighting experience may alter which traits contribute to an individual's RHP.",2017-06-09,,,,,"Lane SM, Briffa M",,,,,,10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.07.012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-3472,,Animal Behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,2017-09-15,13,20,,,,,,,2017-10-01,Accepted,,,,,2017-09-15,,,,,,,Boldness is for rookies: prefight boldness and fighting success in a sea anemone,,,132,2018-09-15,,1,,,,,Animal Behaviour (0003-3472),A,,,Animal Behaviour (0003-3472),1.21,No,,green,07/06/2018 15:12:27,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/9930,Yes,Live,12 months,98B38C5A-C808-4291-9DE1-EFD09D889889,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Scopus,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,Animal Behaviour,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

In this comment on the article by Papanicolaou, we introduce the concept of methodological determinism and discuss the scientific status of the concept of free will. We argue that determinism is an implicit heuristic assumption of modern science, dating back to Newton's optics. Papanicolaou acknowledges that instances of free will being an illusion have been corroborated. We add that the proposition of free will determining behavior is unfalsifiable. It is, therefore, a metaphysical proposition and not a scientific hypothesis.",,,,,,"Kirsch I, Hyland ME",,,,,,10.1037/cns0000135,,,2326-5531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2326-5523,3,"Psychology of Consciousness: Theory Research, and Practice",,,,,,,,,,,,321,323,,,,,,,2017-09-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Methodological determinism and the free will hypothesis.,"Review, Journal",,4,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,No,,green,25/12/2017 17:07:32,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10070,Yes,Live,Unknown,2-s2.0-85029086626,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,"Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice",SHERPA/RoMEO,No

However, this theory is primarily based on relatively simple judgement tasks. We compared groups from Great Britain (an individualist culture) and Saudi Arabia (a collectivist culture) on a more complex comparative visual search task, using simple natural scenes. A higher overall number of fixations for Saudi participants, along with longer search times, indicated less efficient search behaviour than British participants. Furthermore, intra-group comparisons of scan-path for Saudi participants revealed less similarity than within the British group. Together, these findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between an analytic cognitive style and controlled attention.",2017-09-07,,,,,"Alotaibi A, Underwood G, Smith AD",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28946046,,,,,10.1016/j.concog.2017.09.002,,,1090-2376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conscious Cogn,"Culture, Eye movements, ScanMatch, Visual attention, Visual search",,,,,,,,,,2017-09-23,254,265,,,,,,,2017-10,Published online,,,,,2017-09-27,,,,,,,Cultural differences in attention: Eye movement evidence from a comparative visual search task.,,,55,2018-09-23,,0,,0,0,,Consciousness and Cognition (1053-8100),A,,,Consciousness and Cognition (1053-8100),0.958,No,,green,08/06/2018 07:22:02,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/9991,Yes,Live,12 months,3A68414A-C84F-44F7-A46C-E69A545DDBDA,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Consciousness and Cognition,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Background: Pain assessment in children is often poorly executed following acute injury. Whilst a range of pain assessment tools have been developed, little guidance is provided for assessing pain in children with English as an additional language. Design: Factorial survey design. Methods: Twenty minor injuries unit nurses and 20 children's nursing students participated in an electronic survey to make judgements on 12 scenarios describing a child attending a minor injuries unit following an incident, accompanied by a parent. Respondents had to decide the most important form of pain assessment, and whether they would ask a parent or an interpreter to assess the pain of the child. An open-ended question asked about the difficulties found in making a judgement. Results: Observation of the child's behaviour was the most common pain assessment reported. The visual analogue scale was significantly associated with children with proficient English. Respondents were significantly more likely to involve parents in the assessment if they could speak English well compared to parents with poor English skills. Moreover, nursing students were significantly more likely than registered nurses to call for support from an interpreter. Thematic analysis identified three themes related to difficulties with pain assessment: contrasting approaches, differing perceptions of pain and overcoming challenges. Conclusions: The reduced ability to communicate between child, parent and healthcare professional highlights the need to identify forms of assessment based on individual cases. Relevance to clinical practice: The number of children with English as an additional language has seen a marked rise over the last decade. In situations where communication ability is reduced, assessment of pain should be tailored to meet the needs of the child. This may require timely access to interpreter services.",,,,,,"Azize PM, Cattani A, Endacott R",,,,,,10.1111/jocn.14134,,,1365-2702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1067,5-6,Journal of Clinical Nursing,,,,,,,,,,,,1081,1093,,,,,,,2018-03-01,Published,,,,,,,,,,,,Perceived language proficiency and pain assessment by registered and student nurses in native English-speaking and EAL children aged 4–7 years,Journal Article,,27,,,0,,0,0,,Journal of Clinical Nursing (0962-1067),A,,,Journal of Clinical Nursing (0962-1067),0.937,No,,yellow,10/03/2018 04:59:41,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10085,Yes,Live,Unknown,2-s2.0-85040338501,Scopus,Manual; Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Journal of Clinical Nursing,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Conversations are amazing! Although we usually find the experience enjoyable and even relaxing, when one considers the difficulties of simultaneously generating sig- nals that convey an intended message while at the same time trying to understand the messages of another, then the pleasures of conversation may seem rather surprising. We manage to communicate with each other without knowing quite what will happen next. We quickly manufacture precisely timed sounds and gestures on the fly, which we exchange with each other without clashing—even managing to slip in some imita- tions as we go along! Yet usually meaning is all we really notice. In the Conversa- tionPiece project, we aim to transform conversations into musical sounds using neuro-inspired technology to expose the amazing world of sounds people create when talking with others. Sounds from a microphone are separated into different fre- quency bands by a computer-simulated “ear” (more precisely “basilar membrane”) and analyzed for tone onsets using a lateral-inhibition network, similar to some cor- tical neural networks. The detected events are used to generate musical notes played on a synthesizer either instantaneously or delayed. The first option allows for ex- changing timed sound events between two speakers with a speech-like structure, but without conveying (much) meaning. Delayed feedback further allows self-exploration of one’s own speech. We discuss the current setup (ConversationPiece version II), in- sights from first experiments, and options for future applications.",,,,,2017-11-20,,,,,,,,,2017-11-21,,,,,,2017-11-20,,,,,,,ConversationPiece II: Displaced and Rehacked,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,Avant (2082-6710),0.104,Yes,,grey,24/05/2018 04:40:27,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10233,Yes,Live,Unknown,CEEEE80D-AE5D-4EA7-A046-74970C2C19E9,Manual,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,Avant: Journal of Philosophical-Interdisciplinary Vanguard,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Services are developing a range of approaches to deliver this care with a lack of tools to guide implementation. METHODOLOGY: A scoping review and critical examination of current policy, key literature and NHS guidelines, together with stakeholder involvement led to the identification of domains, subdomains and component activities (processes and behaviours) required to deliver P3C. These were validated through codesign with stakeholders via a series of workshops and cognitive interviews. RESULTS: Six core domains of P3C were identified as follows: (i) my goals, (ii) care planning, (iii) transitions, (iv) decision making (v), information and communication and (vi) organizational support activities. These were populated by 29 core subdomains (question items). A number of response codes (components) to each question provide examples of the processes and activities that can be actioned to achieve each core subdomain of P3C. CONCLUSION: The P3C-OCT provides a coherent approach to monitoring progress and supporting practice development towards P3C. It can be used to generate a shared understanding of the core domains of P3C at a service delivery level, and support reorganization of care for those with complex needs. The tool can reliably detect change over time, as demonstrated in a sample of 40 UK general practices. It is currently being used in four UK evaluations of new models of care and being further developed as a training tool for the delivery of P3C.",2017-09-07,,,,,"Horrell J, Lloyd H, Sugavanam T, Close J, Byng R",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139220,,,,,10.1111/hex.12631,,,1369-7625,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1369-6513,,Health Expectations,"barriers, care, centred, coordinated, facilitators, general, implementation, person, practice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-11-15,Published online,,Wiley Open Access,CC BY,,2018-03-06,,,,,,,Creating and facilitating change for Person-Centred Coordinated Care (P3C): The development of the Organisational Change Tool (P3C-OCT).,,,,,Version of Record,0,,0,1,,Health Expectations (1369-6513),B,,,Health Expectations (1369-6513),0.884,No,,green,13/06/2017 03:07:25,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10990,Yes,Live,Unknown,7C3E611A-06D2-4BE9-8E71-5127187B23F2,Manual,Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Health Expectations,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Sixty-six percent (SE: 1.0) of respondents with an anxiety disorder in the intervening period between Waves 1 and 2 had experienced an adverse life event in the year prior to the Wave 1 interview. In logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and psychiatric characteristics, adverse life events at baseline were associated with anxiety disorder onset within the three-year follow up period. The pattern of association between adverse events and anxiety disorder onset was similar across sub-types, and injury, illness or death of family or close friends consistently had the strongest association with anxiety disorder onset.

Previous studies found that listeners show temporally stable idiosyncratic switching patterns when listening to a multi-stable auditory stimulus, such as in the auditory streaming paradigm. This inter-individual variability can be described along two dimensions, Exploration and Segregation. In the current study, we explored the functional brain networks associated with these dimensions and their constituents using electroencephalography. Results showed that Segregation and its constituents are related to brain networks operating in the theta EEG band, whereas Exploration and its constituents are related to networks in the lower and upper alpha and beta bands. Thus, the dimensions on which individuals' perception differ from each other in the auditory streaming paradigm probably reflect separate perceptual processes in the human brain. Further, the results suggest that networks mainly located in left auditory areas underlie the perception of integration, whereas perceiving the alternative patterns is accompanied by stronger interhemispheric connections.",2017-11-27,,,,,"Farkas D, Denham SL, Winkler I",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29197502,,,,,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.11.032,,,1873-3514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-3932,,Neuropsychologia,"EEG, auditory streaming, functional networks, individual differences, minimum spanning tree, perceptual multi-stability",,,,,,,,,,2017-12-02,,,,,,,,,2018-01,Published online,,Elsevier,,,2017-12-12,,,,,,,Functional brain networks underlying idiosyncratic switching patterns in multi-stable auditory perception.,,,,2019-06-02,,1,1,1,0,,Neuropsychologia (0028-3932),A,,,Neuropsychologia (0028-3932),1.12,No,,green,07/06/2018 23:15:10,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10402,Yes,Live,Unknown,229F9B63-2749-4D9E-BC66-97A50E1AAEDC,Manual,Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Neuropsychologia,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

The results of population studies suggest that SAD tends to precede AUD, and the results of laboratory studies suggest that alcohol use facilitates social behaviors in socially anxious individuals. Therefore, we posited that, in a modern context, a tendency to consume alcohol may be positively selected for among socially anxious individuals by its effect on the likelihood of finding a partner and reproducing. We tested the hypothesis that a higher proportion of individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of SAD and AUD reproduce (i.e., have at least one child) relative to individuals with SAD absent AUD in an individual participant meta-analysis based on over 65,000 adults derived from four nationally representative cross-sectional samples. We then cross-validated these findings against the results of a 10-year follow up of one of these surveys. Lifetime history of SAD was not associated with reproduction whereas lifetime history of AUD was positively associated with reproduction. There was no statistically detectable difference in the proportion of individuals with a lifetime history of SAD with or without AUD who reproduced.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CHD. Methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched to April 2016. Retrieved papers, systematic reviews and trial registries were hand-searched. We included RCTs with at least 6 months of follow-up, comparing the direct effects of psychological interventions to usual care for patients following myocardial infarction or revascularisation or with a diagnosis of angina pectoris or CHD defined by angiography. Two authors screened titles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Studies were pooled using random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression was used to explore study-level predictors. Results Thirty-five studies with 10,703 participants (median follow-up 12 months) were included. Psychological interventions led to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (rfcelative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63 to 0.98), although no effects were observed for total mortality, myocardial infarction or revascularisation. Psychological interventions improved depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference [SMD] -0.27, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.15), anxiety (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.09) and stress (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.24) compared with controls. Conclusions We found that psychological intervention improved psychological symptoms and reduced cardiac mortality for people with CHD.

It has been employed to explain important auditory perceptual phenomena, and it has inspired theoretical, experimental and computational modelling efforts aimed at describing how the auditory system parses the complex sound input into meaningful units (auditory scene analysis). These efforts have uncovered some vital questions, addressing which could help to further specify predictive coding and clarify some of its basic assumptions. The goal of the current review is to motivate these questions and show how unresolved issues in explaining some auditory phenomena lead to general questions of the theoretical framework. We focus on experimental and computational modelling issues related to sequential grouping in auditory scene analysis (auditory pattern detection and bistable perception), as we believe that this is the research topic where predictive coding has the highest potential for advancing our understanding. In addition to specific questions, our analysis led us to identify three more general questions that require further clarification: (1) What exactly is meant by prediction in predictive coding? (2) What governs which generative models make the predictions? and (3) What (if it exists) is the correlate of perceptual experience within the predictive coding framework?",2017-11-20,,,,,"Denham SL, Winkler I",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29250827,,,,,10.1111/ejn.13802,,,1460-9568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Eur J Neurosci,"auditory object representation, auditory scene analysis, computational modelling, pattern detection",eng,France,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-12-18,Published online,,,,,,,,,,,,Predictive coding in auditory perception: challenges and unresolved questions.,"Journal Article, Review",,,,,,,0,0,,European Journal of Neuroscience (0953-816X),A,,,European Journal of Neuroscience (0953-816X),0.848,No,,yellow,10/03/2018 04:59:28,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10562,Yes,Live,Unknown,29250827,PubMed,Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,European Journal of Neuroscience,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this ethnic minority associated risk are unknown. We used functional MRI to investigate neural responses to faces of different ethnicity, in individuals of black ethnicity, and a control group of white British ethnicity individuals. METHODS: In total 20 individuals of black ethnicity, and 22 individuals of white British ethnicity underwent a 3T MRI scan while viewing faces of black and white ethnicity. Own group ethnic density was calculated from the 2011 census. Neighbourhood segregation was quantified using the Index of Dissimilarity method. RESULTS: At the within-group level, both groups showed greater right amygdala activation to outgroup faces. Between groups, the black ethnicity group showed greater right amygdala activation to white faces, compared to the white ethnicity group. Within the black ethnicity group, individuals living in areas of lower own group ethnic density showed greater right amygdala reactivity to white faces (r = -0.61, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time an increased amygdala response to white faces has been demonstrated in individuals of black ethnicity. In the black ethnicity group, correlations were observed between amygdala response and neighbourhood variables associated with increased psychosis risk. These results may have relevance for our understanding of the increased rates of paranoia and psychotic disorders in ethnic minority individuals.",,,,,,"McCutcheon R, Bloomfield MAP, Dahoun T, Quinlan M, Terbeck S, Mehta M, Howes O",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29328019,,,,,10.1017/S0033291717003506,,,1469-8978,,"pmc:PMC5933521, nihms:EMS75943",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Psychol Med,"Amygdala, ethnic density, ethnic minority, ethnicity, fMRI, paranoia, psychosis, risk factors, schizophrenia",eng,England,,,,,,,,,1,8,,,,,S0033291717003506,,2018-01-12,Published online,,,,,,,,,,,,Amygdala reactivity in ethnic minorities and its relationship to the social environment: an fMRI study.,Journal Article,,,,,,,0,0,,Psychological Medicine (0033-2917),A,,,Psychological Medicine (0033-2917),1.732,No,,green,09/03/2018 21:58:30,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10610,Yes,Live,Unknown,29328019,PubMed,Europe PubMed Central; Dimensions for Universities,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,Psychological Medicine,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

However, the experience of fighting itself may in turn affect an individual's state, especially if the fight results in injury. Previous studies found a correlation between immune state and fighting success, but the causal direction of this relationship remains unclear. Does immune state determine fighting success? Or does fighting itself influence subsequent immune state? Using the beadlet anemone Actinia equina, we disentangle the cause and effect of this relationship, measuring immune response once pre-fight and twice post-fight. Contrary to previous findings, pre-fight immune response did not predict fighting success, but rather predicted whether an individual used its weapons during the fight. Furthermore, weapon use and contest outcome significantly affected post-fight immune response. Individuals that used their weapons maintained a stable immune response following the fight, while those that fought non-injuriously did not. Furthermore, although winners suffered a similar reduction in immune response to losers immediately post-fight, winners began to recover pre-fight levels within 24 hours. Our findings indicate that immune state can influence strategic fighting decisions and moreover that fight outcome and the agonistic behaviours expressed can significantly affect subsequent immunity.",2017-12-21,,,,,"Lane SM, Briffa M",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29361588,,,,,10.1242/jeb.169201,,,1477-9145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,Journal of Experimental Biology,"Actinia equina, Contest behaviour, Fighting success, Immune response, Injuries, Weapon use",,,,,,,,,,2018-02-20,,,,,,,,,2018-02,Published online,,Company of Biologists,,,2018-02-22,,,,,,,Immune function and the decision to deploy weapons during fights in the beadlet anemone Actinia equina.,,,,2019-02-20,,0,,0,0,,The Journal of Experimental Biology (0022-0949),A,,,Journal of Experimental Biology (0022-0949),1.279,No,,green,12/06/2017 20:04:26,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10842,Yes,Live,Unknown,2F5550B2-9C8D-47AD-B57C-0E15661D4B0D,Manual,Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Journal of Experimental Biology,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Patient input and documentation of that input is key to achieving content validity according to FDA guidelines. This paper describes the process of constructing a new questionnaire to measure the burden of asthma symptoms and burden of treatment in severe asthma, using criteria specified by the FDA. METHODS: A draft severe asthma questionnaire (SAQ) was constructed using qualitative input from severe asthma patients who took part in an earlier study. The aim of this study was to improve that draft questionnaire using a further group of patients. In four iterative focus groups, 16 people with severe asthma completed the draft questionnaire, discussed the wording and structure and suggested changes that were incorporated into the final version. RESULTS: The original intention to ask patients to identify whether problems were caused by asthma symptoms or side effects of medication was abandoned as the attribution of cause was found to be difficult and inconsistent. The recall period of 2 weeks was acceptable but fails to reflect the patients' desire to express the variability of severe asthma. Patients suggested improvements to the wording of the draft questionnaire, including splitting some items in two, combining two items in one, and changes to some of the words in individual items and the response scale. CONCLUSIONS: The final version of the questionnaire was substantially different from one constructed using only qualitative reports from patients about the quality of life deficits of severe asthma. Patients make a valuable contribution to the questionnaire if they are asked to comment and improve an initial draft and where patients are treated as partners in the process of questionnaire construction, rather than only as a source of information to experts who construct the questionnaire.",2018-01-19,,,,,"Hyland ME, Lanario JW, Pooler J, Masoli M, Jones RC",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374455,,,,,10.1186/s12955-018-0851-9,,,1477-7525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1477-7525,1,Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,"Assessment, Content validity, Methodology, Patient reported outcome, Questionnaire construction, Severe asthma",,,,,,,,,,,24,24,,,,,,,2018-01-27,Published online,,BioMed Central,,,2018-02-05,,,,,,,How patient participation was used to develop a questionnaire that is fit for purpose for assessing quality of life in severe asthma.,,,16,,,0,,0,0,,Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (1477-7525),C,,,Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (1477-7525),1.287,Yes,CC BY,green,10/11/2017 00:51:29,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10733,Yes,Live,Unknown,F99941DD-03C3-4057-A998-5FADEEB02A83,Manual,Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Contrast energy thresholds of a 2c/deg sinusoidal grating drifting at 1.0 or 6.0 Hz were measured as a function of added dynamic noise in three tasks: detection of a drifting grating; detection of the sum of two oppositely drifting gratings and direction discrimination of oppositely drifting gratings. Compared to the ideal observer, in both children and adults, the performance for all tasks was limited by reduced sampling efficiency and internal noise. However, the thresholds for discrimination of motion direction and detection of moving gratings show very different developmental profiles. Motion direction discrimination continues to improve after the age of 14 years due to an increase in sampling efficiency that differs with speed. Motion detection and summation were already mature at the age of 5 years, and internal noise was the same for all tasks. These findings were confirmed in a 1-year follow-up study on a group of children from the initial study. The results support suggestions that the detection of a moving pattern and discriminating motion direction are processed by different systems that may develop at different rates.",2014-04-03,,,,,"Falkenberg HK, Simpson WA, Dutton GN",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732568,,,,,10.1016/j.visres.2014.04.001,,,1878-5646,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vision Res,"Development, Internal noise, Motion perception, Sampling efficiency, Adolescent, Analysis of Variance, Child, Child, Preschool, Discrimination (Psychology), Female, Humans, Male, Motion Perception, Pattern Recognition, Visual, Perceptual Masking, Photic Stimulation, Sensory Thresholds",eng,England,,,,,,,,,8,17,,,,,S0042-6989(14)00072-8,,2014-07,Published,,,,,,2015-01-14,,,,,,Development of sampling efficiency and internal noise in motion detection and discrimination in school-aged children.,Journal Article,,100,,,5,5,5,6,0.9468641,Vision Research (0042-6989),B,,,Vision Research (0042-6989),0.989,No,,green,08/06/2018 00:14:29,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10824,Yes,Live,Unknown,24732568,PubMed,Manual; Crossref; Web of Science (Lite); Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,1,Vision Research,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

Both experiments used an oddball paradigm in which participants viewed hierarchical letter stimuli and identified target letters in frequent and rare target trials. The successful identification of targets required attentional flexibility when switching levels of attention (from the frequent global to the rare local attentional level, or vice-versa). Divergent thinkers showed smaller switching times on rare target trials, indicating higher levels of attentional flexibility. Furthermore, divergent thinkers engaged cognitive control processes more strongly at the moment of the attentional switch (and before the response), as indicated by a larger N2 difference between frequent and rare targets. In contrast, creative achievement was associated with neither the switching times on rare target trials, nor with a larger N2 difference between frequent and rare targets. All results held when controlling for general intelligence. Results from these studies provide evidence that divergent thinking is associated with higher attentional flexibility and that such attentional flexibility relies on cognitive control processes required when disengaging from one level of attention (e.g., global), and shifting to the other level of attention (e.g., local).",2018-02-10,,,,,"Zabelina DL, Ganis G",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447843,,,,,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.02.014,,,1873-3514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neuropsychologia,"ERP, N2, attention, cognitive control, creativity, divergent thinking",,,,,,,,,,2018-02-13,,,,,,,,,,Published online,,,,,2018-03-06,,,,,,,"Creativity and cognitive control: Behavioral and ERP evidence that divergent thinking, but not real-life creative achievement, relates to better cognitive control.",,,,2019-02-13,,0,,0,0,,Neuropsychologia (0028-3932),A,,,Neuropsychologia (0028-3932),1.12,No,,green,07/06/2018 23:15:10,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/11223,Yes,Live,Unknown,41A0BC68-DF9A-4491-913B-7FA379CFE6BB,Manual,PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,Neuropsychologia,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

The study of early bilingualism is central to current psycholinguistics, offering insights into issues such as transfer and interference in development. From an applied perspective, it poses a universal challenge to language assessment practices throughout childhood, as typically developing bilingual children usually underperform relative to monolingual norms when assessed in one language only. We measured vocabulary with Communicative Development Inventories for 372 24-month-old toddlers learning British English and one Additional Language out of a diverse set of 13 (Bengali, Cantonese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi-Urdu, Italian, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Welsh). We furthered theoretical understanding of bilingual development by showing, for the first time, that linguistic distance between the child's two languages predicts vocabulary outcome, with phonological overlap related to expressive vocabulary, and word order typology and morphological complexity related to receptive vocabulary, in the Additional Language. Our study also has crucial clinical implications: we have developed the first bilingual norms for expressive and receptive vocabulary for 24-month-olds learning British English and an Additional Language. These norms were derived from factors identified as uniquely predicting CDI vocabulary measures: the relative amount of English versus the Additional Language in child-directed input and parental overheard speech, and infant gender. The resulting UKBTAT tool was able to accurately predict the English vocabulary of an additional group of 58 bilinguals learning an Additional Language outside our target range. This offers a pragmatic method for the assessment of children in the majority language when no tool exists in the Additional Language.

everyday pro- and antisocial risk-taking behaviour. We use the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) of
personality to measure approach, avoidance, and inhibition dispositions, as well as measures of Callous-
Unemotional and psychopathic personalities. In an international sample of 454 respondents, results showed that
RST, psychopathic personality, and callous-unemotional measures accounted for different aspects of risk-taking
behaviour. Specifically, traits associated with ‘fearlessness’ related more to ‘prosocial’ (recreational and social)
risk-taking, whilst traits associated with ‘impulsivity’ related more to ‘antisocial’ (ethical and health) risk-taking.
Further, we demonstrate that psychopathic personality may be demonstrated by combining the RST and callousunemotional
traits (high impulsivity, callousness, and low fear). Overall this study showed how impulsive,
fearless and antisocial traits can be used in combination to identify pro- and anti-social risk-taking behaviours;
suggestions for future research are indicated.",2018-02-28,,,,,"Satchell, L.P., Bacon AM, Firth JL, Corr PJ",,,,,,10.1016/j.paid.2018.02.039,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0191-8869,,Personality and Individual Differences,,,,,,,,,,,,162,169,,,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,,2018-02-28,,,,,,,Risk as Reward:  Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory and Psychopathic Personality Perspectives on Everyday Risk-Taking,,,128,2020-02-28,Accepted Manuscript,0,,,,,Personality and Individual Differences (0191-8869),B,,,Personality and Individual Differences (0191-8869),1.183,No,,green,08/06/2018 00:16:17,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/10899,Yes,Live,Unknown,6F7A305C-A367-44E4-B4C4-E64FD8C6752F,Manual,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,Personality and Individual Differences,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

This research examined two new educational activities designed to empower European educators and school students to engage with the topic of marine litter, particularly focusing on behavior and on known determinants of behavior rather than knowledge alone. In Study 1, 120 educators participated in an online training course on marine litter, and completed a pre- and post-course questionnaire to assess change. After participating in the course, educators felt significantly more skillful and confident to incorporate marine litter education into their future teaching. In Study 2, 341 school students (7–18 years old) participated in an educational video competition on marine litter, and completed a pre-post questionnaire to assess change. Following the educational activity, students were more concerned about marine litter, had a better understanding of the issue, causes and impacts, and reported performing more waste-reduction behaviors. This research brings together educational and behavioral literatures and demonstrates how educational activities can be documented and evaluated systematically in the quest of tackling marine litter.",2018-02-01,,,,,"Hartley BL, Pahl S, Holland M, Alampei I, Veiga JM, Thompson RC",,,,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.02.002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0308-597X,,Marine Policy,,,,,,,,,,,2018-02-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-05-01,,,,,,,Turning the tide on trash: Empowering European educators and school students to tackle marine litter,Article,,,2019-08-12,,0,,,,,Marine Policy (0308-597X),A,,,Marine Policy (0308-597X),1.182,No,,green,08/06/2018 01:15:01,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/11392,Yes,Live,Unknown,B5ECA9D6-D677-4BB3-A7AC-FC69EA96703C,Manual,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,Marine Policy,SHERPA/RoMEO,No

In Experiment 1, 211 adults reviewed a solicitation and rated their intention of contacting an ""activation number"" for a prize. Scarcity and authority were manipulated. Many (48.82%) indicated some willingness to contact to ""activate"" the winnings. Intention of responding was inversely related to the perception of risk (b = -.441, p < .001) and positively associated with perception of benefits (b = .554, p < .001), but not with the experimental condition. In Experiment 2, 291 adults were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions (low, medium, or high activation fee), and were asked to report willingness to contact. Activation fees decreased intent to contact, but percentages remained high (25.70%), with higher perception of risk reducing contact rates (b = -.581, p < .001), and benefit perception increasing intent to contact (b = .381, p < .001). Our studies indicate that consumers are responding to perceived risks and benefits in their decision-making, regardless of persuasion elements used by scammers. In summary, our studies find that consumers with lower levels of education and high perception of benefits are at increased risk for mass marketing scams.

The RPE signal has been hypothesized to simultaneously embody the valence of an outcome (better or worse than expected) and its surprise (how far from expectations). Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that separate representations of the two RPE components exist in the human brain. Meta-analyses provide an opportunity to test this hypothesis and directly probe the extent to which the valence and surprise of the error signal are encoded in separate or overlapping networks. We carried out several meta-analyses on a large set of fMRI studies investigating the neural basis of RPE, locked at decision outcome. We identified two valence learning systems by pooling studies searching for differential neural activity in response to categorical positive-versus-negative outcomes. The first valence network (negative > positive) involved areas regulating alertness and switching behaviours such as the midcingulate cortex, the thalamus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex whereas the second valence network (positive > negative) encompassed regions of the human reward circuitry such as the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We also found evidence of a largely distinct surprise-encoding network including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and dorsal striatum. Together with recent animal and electrophysiological evidence this meta-analysis points to a sequential and distributed encoding of different components of the RPE signal, with potentially distinct functional roles.",2018-03-07,,,,,"Fouragnan E, Retzler C, Philiastides MG",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29575249,,,,,10.1002/hbm.24047,,,1097-0193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1065-9471,,Human Brain Mapping,"decision making, learning, meta-analysis, prediction error, reward",,,,,,,,,,2018-03-25,,,,,,,,,,,,Wiley,,,2018-05-18,,,,,,,Separate neural representations of prediction error valence and surprise: Evidence from an fMRI meta-analysis.,,,,2019-03-25,,0,,0,0,,Human Brain Mapping (1065-9471),A,,,Human Brain Mapping (1065-9471),1.346,No,,yellow,10/03/2018 05:00:53,1,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/11506,Yes,Live,No embargo,68B00088-9CF9-4A08-BED6-64129FAEC095,Manual,PubMed; Europe PubMed Central; Scopus; Dimensions for Universities,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,Human Brain Mapping,SHERPA/RoMEO,No
